      "On the road across all competitions, Aberdeen have stayed unbeaten in 5 of their last 6 and claimed 7 clean sheets in their last 17 away outings. There is resilience, though they have also lost by 2 or more in 5 of their last 12 away matches, a sign that when they do crack, the margin can widen.",
      "The League Stage trend tells a harsher story for the visitors. Aberdeen are winless in 13 of their last 16 Conference League matches and have lost 50% of their last 14 in this competition, with 50% of their last 10 ending level. It is a sequence that explains their current placement despite some recent upticks elsewhere.",
      "Sparta’s broader body of work is stronger.

Across all competitions, they are undefeated in 80% of their last 15 and have won 55% of their last 40 overall.",

    "excerpt_en": "Sparta Praha faces Aberdeen’s in the UEFA Conference League. Sparta's dominance against Aberdeen's solid defense – who will win? We analyze both teams' strengths and weaknesses and predict the expected score.",
    "content_en": "# Sparta vs Aberdeen’s: A Pivotal UEFA Conference League Showdown\n\nSparta Praha and Aberdeen’s face off in a crucial UEFA Conference League match. Sparta aims to secure the top spot in the group, while Aberdeen desperately needs a win to keep their hopes alive. Let's analyze both teams' strategies and key points to predict the outcome.\n\n## 📊 Team Analysis\n\n**Sparta**\n- Recent form: 4 wins, 1 draw, 1 loss\n- Strengths/weaknesses: Sparta excels in dominating matches with a strong midfield and high possession. Their attacking force is also decent, but their home performance can be inconsistent. It's worth noting that they haven't won in their last three home games.\n\n**Aberdeen’s**\n- Recent form: 3 wins, 2 draws, 1 loss\n- Strengths/weaknesses: Aberdeen is adept at minimizing goals conceded with tight organization and defensive focus. They've shown stable defense, conceding only 1.17 goals in their last six matches. However, they lack creativity in attack and their away performance is somewhat weaker.\n\n## 🎯 Tactical Preview\n\n### Sparta's Approach\nSparta is expected to utilize a 4-3-3 formation, focusing on pressing in midfield and securing possession. They will aim to score through the active movements of their wingers and the finishing ability of their central striker. With over 67% ball possession, they are likely to overwhelm their opponents.\n\n### Aberdeen’s's Counter\nAberdeen will likely adopt a 5-4-1 formation to build a solid defensive line and look for counter-attack opportunities. The midfielders will aggressively press to disrupt Sparta's attack and aim to score through quick counter-attacks. Their attacking power, generating over 15 shots, cannot be ignored.\n\n## 💡 Key Battles\n\n1. **Sparta's Home Performance Recovery**: It's crucial whether Sparta, who have been struggling at home recently, can recover their performance with the support of their home fans in this match.\n2. **Aberdeen's Defensive Focus**: How well Aberdeen can maintain their defensive focus against Sparta's strong attack will be a crucial factor determining the outcome.\n3. **Midfield Battle Winner**: As the role of the midfield is important for both teams, the team that gains the upper hand in the midfield battle is likely to lead the game.\n\n## 📈 Prediction\n\n**Expected Score**: 2-1\n\nSparta is expected to win narrowly against Aberdeen at home. Sparta's strong attack and home advantage are likely to break through Aberdeen's defense, but Aberdeen is also likely to show their potential and score one goal. Sparta is unbeaten in 6 of their last 7 Conference League home matches.\n",

At home, 85% of their last 40 have finished without defeat, and 50% of their last 12 home wins came by 2 or more goals.",
      "Rijeka arrive with a different profile but similarly positive momentum.

      "The split in approach is clear. Shakhtar’s control game routinely produces territory and shooting volume, while Rijeka prefer a compact block and quick surges through the middle third. Rijeka’s recent streaks are notable: three consecutive wins, each by 2 or more goals. They also have been undefeated in 10 of their last 12 matches in all competitions (83%).",
      "There is a caveat away from home for the Croatian side. Rijeka are winless in 5 of their last 6 away matches in all competitions (83%), and 50% of that run ended level. Against a side that regularly tilts the pitch, that away trend could matter, especially if Shakhtar again reach their usual 6 to 7 shots on target at home.",
      "Tactically, this shapes as 4-1-4-1 or 4-2-3-1 for Shakhtar, with two playmakers between the lines and energetic wide midfielders pinning back full backs. Rijeka’s best work has come from a 4-2-3-1 that keeps distances tight, trusting the double pivot to clog central lanes and spring the front four into space.",
      "Individual battles should be decisive. Shakhtar’s midfield trio of Oleg Ocheretko, Dmytro Kryskiv and Pedrinho has balanced control with penetration in recent weeks, while Newerton and Lucas Ferreira offer direct running from the flanks. Lassina Traoré provides a traditional reference point up front and a target for early crosses.",
      "For Rijeka, Tiago Dantas sets the rhythm at the base, with Niko Janković and Amer Gojak offering vertical passing and late entries into the box. Width from Toni Fruk and Luka Menalo stretches back lines, and Ante Matej Jurić works the channels. The defensive axis of Stjepan Radeljić and Ante Majstorović has been stingy in this league stage, part of a unit that has allowed just two goals in five matches."

      "Two teams with similar records but very different rhythms meet with qualification nuance hanging in the air. Sigma’s slide contrasts with Lech’s measured consistency, and the numbers hint at a cagey contest where small margins could decide everything.",
      "Both clubs sit on 7 points after five UEFA Europa Conference League league-stage matches, but the paths have differed. Sigma Olomouc are 22nd with 2 wins, 1 draw and 2 losses, scoring 6 and conceding 7. Lech Poznan are 20th with the same 2 wins, 1 draw and 2 losses, yet a stronger goal profile at 10 for and 7 against. The table says even; the trend lines say otherwise.",
      "Recent form for Sigma has been rough. Over the last six in all competitions they have 1 win, 1 draw and 4 losses, averaging 0.83 goals scored and 2 conceded. Their overall shot production sits at 12.83 attempts per match with 3.33 on target, alongside 49.33% possession. The bright spot comes from their last three at home in all competitions, where they posted 2 wins and 1 loss, scoring 1.33 and conceding 0.67 with improved 4.67 shots on target from 13 total attempts, even if possession dipped to 42.67%.",
      "Lech arrive on a steady run. Across their last six in all competitions they are unbeaten with 3 wins and 3 draws, scoring 1.83 and conceding 0.67 on average. Their shot profile is strong at 13.83 attempts and 4.83 on target per match, and they have controlled the ball at 55.17%. That blend of volume and defensive restraint has underpinned their 100% unbeaten streak across those six.",
      "Comparing the underlying numbers, Lech’s attack has the higher ceiling with 10 league-stage goals from five matches and better chance creation lately. Sigma’s recent defensive tightening at home matters, though, especially given those 0.67 goals conceded across their last three home outings in all competitions. The game state could favor a controlled tempo, with Lech’s 55.17% possession average meeting a Sigma side comfortable without the ball.",
      "The trends add important context. Sigma have lost each of their last 4 in all competitions and are winless in 4 straight. Yet at home they have kept clean sheets in 58% of their last 12 and have been undefeated in 83% of those 12, winning 6. It is a profile of a side far more resilient on their own pitch than their recent overall skid suggests.",
      "For Lech, resilience travels. They are undefeated in 16 of their last 20 away matches in all competitions and have posted 13 clean sheets across their last 32 away fixtures. In all competitions they have been undefeated in 80% of their last 15. League-specific numbers show a strong backbone too, with 16 undefeated in their last 20 Conference League matches, though they have also lost 3 of their last 6 in the competition, hinting at occasional volatility.",
      "Personnel could tilt fine margins. Sigma are without Yunusa Muritala, removing a direct outlet in transition. Lech lack Patrik Wålemark and Daniel Håkans, while Luis Palma is suspended. That pushes creative burden toward Ali Gholizadeh and Leo Bengtsson in support of Mikael Ishak, with Pablo Rodríguez linking play. For Sigma, craft and control fall to Radim Breite and Michal Beran, while Jáchym Šíp and Artur Dolznikov must supply the final-third spark.",
      "Tactically, both sides have leaned on 4-2-3-1 in their recent samples. Sigma’s recent home data suggests a compact block and selective pressing, while Lech’s structure should emphasize ball circulation and diagonal service to the flanks. Set pieces and second phases may be decisive given the expected territorial balance."

Over the last six in all competitions they have 1 win, 1 draw and 4 losses, averaging 0.83 goals scored and 2 conceded. Their overall shot production sits at 12.83 attempts per match with 3.33 on target, alongside 49.33% possession. The bright spot comes from their last three at home in all competitions, where they posted 2 wins and 1 loss, scoring 1.33 and conceding 0.67 with improved 4.67 shots on target from 13 total attempts, even if possession dipped to 42.67%.\n\nLech arrive on a steady run. Across their last six in all competitions they are unbeaten with 3 wins and 3 draws, scoring 1.83 and conceding 0.67 on average. Their shot profile is strong at 13.83 attempts and 4.83 on target per match, and they have controlled the ball at 55.17%. That blend of volume and defensive restraint has underpinned their 100% unbeaten streak across those six.\n\nComparing the underlying numbers, Lech’s attack has the higher ceiling with 10 league-stage goals from five matches and better chance creation lately. Sigma’s recent defensive tightening at home matters, though, especially given those 0.67 goals conceded across their last three home outings in all competitions. The game state could favor a controlled tempo, with Lech’s 55.17% possession average meeting a Sigma side comfortable without the ball.\n\nThe trends add important context. Sigma have lost each of their last 4 in all competitions and are winless in 4 straight. Yet at home they have kept clean sheets in 58% of their last 12 and have been undefeated in 83% of those 12, winning 6. It is a profile of a side far more resilient on their own pitch than their recent overall skid suggests.\n\nFor Lech, resilience travels. They are undefeated in 16 of their last 20 away matches in all competitions and have posted 13 clean sheets across their last 32 away fixtures. In all competitions they have been undefeated in 80% of their last 15. League-specific numbers show a strong backbone too, with 16 undefeated in their last 20 Conference League matches, though they have also lost 3 of their last 6 in the competition, hinting at occasional volatility.\n\nPersonnel could tilt fine margins. Sigma are without Yunusa Muritala, removing a direct outlet in transition. Lech lack Patrik Wålemark and Daniel Håkans, while Luis Palma is suspended. That pushes creative burden toward Ali Gholizadeh and Leo Bengtsson in support of Mikael Ishak, with Pablo Rodríguez linking play. For Sigma, craft and control fall to Radim Breite and Michal Beran, while Jáchym Šíp and Artur Dolznikov must supply the final-third spark.\n\nTactically, both sides have leaned on 4-2-3-1 in their recent samples. Sigma’s recent home data suggests a compact block and selective pressing, while Lech’s structure should emphasize ball circulation and diagonal service to the flanks. Set pieces and second phases may be decisive given the expected territorial balance.",
