      "Bologna have had mixed fortunes in their last six home meetings with Atalanta, winning two, drawing two, and losing two. This pattern speaks to the competitive edge between the sides and suggests that home field has offered only a minimal advantage over recent years.",

They've failed to win any of their last five matches in all competitions and remain winless in 6 of their last 7 outings. During their latest six matches, they've secured just one win, drawn twice, and lost three times, with an average of 0.83 goals scored and 1.5 conceded per game.",
      "The situation at home mirrors their larger struggles. In their last three at Dall'Ara, Bologna have drawn two and lost one, managing only 0.67 goals on average while conceding one per match. Ball retention has hovered at just above 50%, and shots on target have been modest.",
      "Atalanta, by contrast, approach this fixture with confidence from strong away performances. They've won four and lost two of their last six matches, hitting the net at a steady rate of 1.17 goals per game and conceding just once per outing. Their shot volume is slightly higher than Bologna's, averaging over 13 total shots per match in recent away games.",

This meeting pits two teams with similar struggles and strengths, with little separating them on paper throughout the season.",
      "The last time these sides met, Cagliari narrowly edged Cremonese in Sardinia, with a 1-0 victory coming courtesy of Gianluca Lapadula’s finish. Cremonese actually enjoyed a slight edge in ball possession at 51% and created more shots on target – six compared to Cagliari’s four. However, Cagliari looked more threatening in dangerous attacks, tallying 65 to Cremonese’s 33, and ultimately converted that superiority into three points just past the hour mark.",
      "If history is any indicator, tight margins can be expected once again. The two clubs remain neck-and-neck in the league table. Cremonese are 13th with 5 wins, 6 draws, and 7 losses, scoring 18 and conceding 21 in their 18 matches. Cagliari sit right behind in 14th, having won 4, drawn 6, and lost 8, with 19 goals for and 25 against.",
      "Cremonese’s record at home reveals both promise and issues. They have tasted defeat in 3 of their last 6 home fixtures and only kept clean sheets in 42% of their last 12 at Stadio Giovanni Zini. Remarkably though, Cremonese haven’t been defeated in 82% of their last 22 home games and drawn half of those, indicating just how often points are shared here. Still, they haven’t won in 8 of their last 10 home matches.",
      "On the other hand, Cagliari’s away form leaves much to be desired. Winless in 10 of their last 12 away matches, and losing 50% of those, Cagliari have also struggled to claim maximum points on the road. In the broader context, they are winless in 13 of their last 15 games in all competitions, a spell which highlights their struggle for consistency.",
      "When examining recent performances, Cremonese have only managed two wins in their last six matches in all competitions. Their attack has sputtered with an average of 0.83 goals scored per match, while conceding at the same rate. Recent home matches are no remedy either, with the side netting just one goal per home game and conceding 1.67 on average.",
      "Cagliari mirror that narrative; over their last six, they have registered two wins, two draws, and two defeats. Offensively, they’ve done slightly better with 1.17 scored per match, but their rear guard has been vulnerable, conceding at the same rate. Their average possession hovers at 46% away from home, and total shots per match stands at 9.83, suggesting they are far from passive even when not in front of their own supporters.",
      "The visitors’ squad is especially light due to a wave of injuries and absences. Cagliari will be without Michael Folorunsho, Joseph Liteta, Andrea Belotti, Yerry Mina, Zito Luvumbo, Mattia Felici, and Juan Rodríguez for this match. Cremonese, for their part, are missing Warren Bondo and Daniel Frey.",
