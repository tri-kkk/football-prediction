      "Nijmegen have put together an impressive string of results in their last six outings, securing four wins and drawing twice, while keeping their loss column untouched. Over this period, they have averaged nearly three goals per match, showing attacking prowess balanced by a defense conceding just under two. At home, they have won two and drawn one of their last three, scoring 2.33 per match and conceding just one.",
      "Utrecht’s recent form tells a different story. In their last six, they have managed only one win alongside three draws and two defeats, scoring an average of 1.33 and conceding by the same measure. On the road, their ability to grind out points is visible, with a pattern of draws but not enough victories to climb the table.",

They have been undefeated in 16 of their last 20 matches across all competitions, and bring a 7 match undefeated run into this fixture. At home, they are even more formidable—20 games unbeaten in their last 25. Additionally, there is a positive record when winning by two or more goals, which has occurred in 39% of their last 23 matches.",
