      "Bologna’s steady climb into the Serie A top five has not come by accident. Built on control, clean sheets and a clear identity, Andrade Davis Nicolas’ side now faces a Cremonese outfit searching for stability and goals. With one team quietly establishing European credentials and the other trying to halt a worrying slide, this meeting at the Dall’Ara looks like a test of maturity for the hosts and resilience for the visitors.",
      "These two clubs do not share a long, intense Serie A storyline, but their latest clash in Bologna offered a useful reference point. The last time Cremonese visited the Dall’Ara in the league, the match finished in a draw, giving Bologna a home record of 0 wins, 1 draw and 0 losses from their last 1 home encounter against the Grigiorossi. That stalemate underlined how awkward Cremonese can be to break down when they stay compact, and it lingers as a reminder that Bologna, for all their progress, still have to work hard to convert dominance into victories against well-organised visitors.",
      "Bologna enter this match in quietly imposing shape. Over their last 6 matches in all competitions, they are unbeaten with 3 wins, 3 draws and 0 losses. They have averaged 1.67 goals scored and only 0.5 conceded per game across that spell, suggesting a strong balance between attack and defence. The performance data backs that up: around 12.67 total shots per match, with 3.83 on target and an average possession of 55.67% shows a side that tends to control the ball and create a steady flow of chances rather than relying on chaotic spells.",
      "At home, Bologna’s last 3 fixtures have been even more defensively assured. They have 1 win, 2 draws and 0 defeats, scoring 0.67 goals per game but conceding none. The goal output is modest, yet the clean sheet record highlights how difficult it has become for visiting sides to find a way through at the Dall’Ara. They still average 12.67 shots and 3 on target with the same 55.67% possession at home in that short run, pointing to a consistent pattern of control even when the scoreboard has not always fully reflected their superiority.",
      "Cremonese’s recent path contrasts sharply. Across their last 6 matches in all competitions, they have 1 win, 2 draws and 3 losses. They are scoring 1 goal per game and conceding 1.33 on average, with 10.33 shots per match, 3.67 on target and roughly 49.17% possession. That paints a picture of a team that can create enough to be competitive but often finds itself on the wrong side of fine margins, especially defensively.",
      "The trend becomes more concerning when we stretch the sample. Cremonese have drawn 5 of their last 10 matches in all competitions and lost 4 of their last 8. Crucially, they have been winless in 11 of their last 11 matches in all competitions, an 82% winless rate in that sequence, and they come into this game on a run of 3 straight defeats and 3 straight matches without a victory. Stopping that slide against one of the league’s more settled outfits will require a significant improvement in both penalty-box areas.",
      "In Serie A, Bologna’s season so far looks firmly like that of a top-tier side. They sit 5th after 12 league games, with 7 wins, 3 draws and only 2 defeats. They have scored 21 goals, an average of 1.75 per match, and conceded just 8, or 0.67 per game, giving them a healthy goal difference of +13. Those numbers are not built on a short burst either. Over their last 40 league matches they have won 50%, and they are undefeated in 83% of their last 12 Serie A fixtures. At home in the league, they have won 63% of their last 40 games and are undefeated in 90% of their last 20, recording clean sheets in 50% of those 20 home encounters. This is one of the most reliable home records in the division.",
      "Cremonese, by contrast, are sitting 11th after 12 league matches. Their Serie A record reads 3 wins, 5 draws and 4 losses, with 13 goals scored, an average of 1.08 per match, and 16 conceded, 1.33 per game, for a goal difference of -3. It is not disastrous, but it illustrates a side that struggles to outscore opponents and often ends up sharing points or narrowly losing. Their broader trend, with extended winless sequences in all competitions, suggests that turning performances into consistent results has been a persistent issue for Davide Nicola’s men.",
      "Bologna’s long-term statistical profile is impressive. In all competitions, they have won 50% of their last 16 matches and drawn 50% of their last 6, underlining a habit of avoiding defeat. They have remained undefeated in 87% of their last 15 matches in all competitions and are currently undefeated in each of their last 11 games, a 100% undefeated run in that span. They have also recorded wins by 2 or more goals in 38% of their last 13 matches in all competitions, and that same 38% rate holds across their last 13 league games, showing that when they get on top, they often do so with a measure of comfort.",
      "At home, the strength is even clearer. Bologna have been undefeated in 92% of their last 12 home matches in all competitions and have kept 7 clean sheets across their last 15 home outings. In Serie A at the Dall’Ara, they have won 63% of their last 40 matches and stayed undefeated in 90% of their last 20, with half of those games ending in clean sheets. These are the underlying numbers of a side that trusts its defensive structure and rarely collapses.",
      "Cremonese’s main trend is almost the mirror image. Their last 10 matches in all competitions have brought 5 draws, underlining their tendency to be involved in tight games where neither side fully seizes control. However, with 4 defeats in their last 8 and that statistic of being winless in 11 of their last 11 matches in all competitions, confidence and momentum are clearly issues. Defensively they are not being overwhelmed, but their inability to string wins together leaves them vulnerable against teams with sharper attacking patterns."

      "Two teams searching for stability rather than headlines meet in Vallecas, with Rayo Vallecano trying to turn solid performances into consistency and Valencia looking to climb away from the lower reaches of La Liga. The numbers suggest a tight, tactical contest rather than a spectacle, with both sides showing clear strengths and very obvious flaws.",
      "Rayo Vallecano arrive in this match with the quiet confidence of a side that has become very hard to beat, especially at Estadio de Vallecas. Iñigo Pérez’s team sit 11th in La Liga with 4 wins, 4 draws and 5 losses, but that mid-table label hides some impressive underlying trends, particularly on their own pitch, where control of the ball and defensive resilience have become a clear identity.",
      "Recent history between these two in Vallecas leans slightly towards the hosts. In the last 6 home meetings in La Liga, Rayo have taken 2 wins, shared the points 3 times and lost only once. That means they have avoided defeat in 5 of those 6 fixtures against Valencia on this ground, a pattern that matches up neatly with their broader home record in the league.",
      "Rayo’s broader form points to a team that knows how to stay in matches. Across their last 6 La Liga games they have 3 wins, 2 draws and just 1 defeat, scoring 1.67 goals and conceding 1.17 per match. In all competitions they have won 50% of their last 12 outings and have not been beaten in 9 of their last 11. At Vallecas the numbers are even more convincing: undefeated in 12 of their last 15 league home matches and registering 4 clean sheets in their last 10 league home fixtures.",
      "The issue, however, is turning draws into wins. Rayo have drawn 53% of their last 15 home league games and are winless in 11 of their last 13 at home in La Liga. They are very hard to break down but often lack the ruthless edge to finish opponents off. The underlying performance metrics are strong: in the last 3 home matches they average 19 shots per game, 4.33 on target and 54.67% possession, conceding just 0.67 goals per match. The structure is solid, but the finishing touch is not always there.",
      "Valencia, under Carlos Corberán, come into this one in a more precarious position. They sit 15th with 3 wins, 4 draws and 6 defeats, sharing Rayo’s 12 goals scored but conceding significantly more with 21 against, an average of 1.62 per game. That negative goal difference of -9 underlines a side that can be punished, especially away from Mestalla, where their long-term numbers are worrying.",
      "Across all competitions, Valencia have lost 4 of their last 8 matches and 5 of their last 10 away. More striking is their away run: they have not won in 13 of their last 16 away fixtures. In the league they have lost 8 of their last 16 matches and failed to win in 8 of their last 10 La Liga games overall. Their recent sample in all competitions paints a picture of balance on the scoreboard – 2 wins, 2 draws and 2 losses in the last 6, with 1.17 goals scored and 1.17 conceded per match – but the long-term away pattern remains a major concern.",
      "With the ball, Valencia are less dominant than Rayo. Over their last 6 fixtures they average 12.33 total shots and 3.83 on target, holding the ball for 49.67% of the time. Away from home, that drops further in terms of possession, and Corberán has often leaned on a more direct, transition-based approach. That fits with their player profile in attack but risks ceding the initiative in Vallecas against a Rayo side happy to keep the ball and probe."

With both teams in the top three and separated by fine margins in the table, this meeting has the feel of a test of how sustainable each project really is.",
      "Roma arrive in this match carrying the authority of a side that has turned results into a habit. Top of Serie A with 9 wins and 3 losses from 12 games, they have done it with control rather than chaos, scoring 15 goals at an average of 1.25 per game while conceding only 6 at 0.5 per match. That defensive platform has underpinned a run where they have been undefeated in 82% of their last 38 league fixtures and particularly dominant at the Olimpico, winning 27 of their last 40 home games in Serie A.",
      "The recent numbers sharpen that picture even further. Over their last 6 matches in all competitions, Roma have 5 wins and 1 loss, scoring 1.67 and conceding just 0.5 per game. Their play has been structured around possession and sustained pressure: an average of 15.33 total shots, 5.5 on target and 58.33% possession. At home across the last 3 outings those figures rise to 17 shots, 6 on target and 62% possession, evidence of a side comfortable pinning opponents back and keeping them there.",
      "Napoli, for their part, travel with solid credentials of their own. Conte’s team sit third with 8 wins, 1 draw and 3 defeats from 12, scoring 19 goals at 1.58 per game and conceding 11 at 0.92. Stretch the lens to 40 league matches and Napoli have won 60%, remaining undefeated in 85% of their last 20 Serie A outings. Those numbers reflect a side that has learned to manage games with maturity, often controlling tempo through midfield and striking with precision when chances appear.",
      "However, the away form tells a more nuanced story. Across their last 10 away games in all competitions, Napoli have lost 50%, and in their last 6 away matches they have been winless in 5 of those 6. Even more striking, they have lost by 2 or more goals in 43% of their last 7 away fixtures. While the overall Conte blueprint is clearly working, the team has not always transported its authority from Naples to hostile grounds.",
      "The historical balance between the sides in Rome has been relatively even. In the last 5 league meetings at the Olimpico, Roma have taken 1 win, there have been 2 draws and Napoli have 2 victories. Broaden that to the last 10 home clashes for Roma against Napoli in all competitions and the hosts have lost 50% of those matches, suggesting that Napoli have often found ways to disrupt Roma’s rhythm in this stadium, even when the Giallorossi have been strong overall in the league.",
      "Longer term trends give Roma reason for confidence. They have been undefeated in 21 of their last 26 home matches in all competitions and have won 26 of their last 40 home games overall, many of them with authority: 39% of their last 28 home fixtures in all competitions have been won by 2 or more goals. In Serie A alone, 38% of their last 21 home league matches have been victories by at least a 2 goal margin. Defensively, the profile is robust too, with 14 clean sheets in their last 30 home league games and average shots on target conceded kept under tight control.",

Across their last 40 matches in all competitions they have won 60% and been undefeated in 85%. Yet away from home, while there are 12 clean sheets in their last 30 away matches, the more recent pattern shows vulnerability, particularly when forced to chase games.

Angers’ home form looks even more robust, remaining unbeaten in their last three matches at Stade Raymond Kopa by winning two and drawing one, while conceding just 0.33 goals per game.",
      "Lens, by contrast, have carved out a formidable run, chalking up five victories from their past six matches while displaying attacking verve with two goals scored per game on average. Their recent surge includes a current streak of three consecutive wins. Out of their last 12 games in all competitions, Lens haven't been defeated in 10, with a 75% win rate that highlights their credentials as one of Ligue 1’s in-form teams.",

In the last three matches between these two sides, Lens have come out on top each time, taking all three points on every occasion. This dominance forms a psychological edge for Lens and underlines the challenge Angers face in overturning the trend.",

They have also remained undefeated in six of their last seven home encounters. However, a 50% loss rate over their last 28 matches in all competitions hints at inconsistency over the longer term.",

Despite only owning 34% of possession and facing 49 dangerous attacks from Rapid, LASK were highly organized defensively.
