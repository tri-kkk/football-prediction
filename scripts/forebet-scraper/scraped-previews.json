      "Two sides separated by a single point in the La Liga table meet at Son Moix with more than just mid-table pride at stake. Real Mallorca and Osasuna both know that a narrow victory could reshape their season, while another setback would keep them anchored near the danger zone.",
      "These two clubs know each other well, and their recent clashes have usually been balanced affairs. Across the last 5 meetings in all competitions, Mallorca have managed 1 win, Osasuna have taken 1, and there have been 3 draws. That pattern mirrors how these games tend to feel: tight, physical and often decided by small details rather than long stretches of dominance from either side.",
      "Those 5 matches underline how difficult it is for either team to pull clear. Mallorca have avoided defeat in 4 of those 5 encounters, which quietly suggests a slight psychological edge, particularly when they can lean on structure and defensive discipline. For Osasuna, that run shows they are rarely outclassed by Mallorca, but also that turning parity into victories has been an issue.",
      "Mallorca come into this fixture with a solid base of results over their last 6 matches in all competitions: 3 wins, 1 draw and 2 losses. They have scored an average of 1.33 goals and conceded 1.17, generated 14.83 shots per match with 4.83 on target, and held 51.33% possession. Those numbers describe a side that is competitive in most phases, with enough attacking output to trouble opponents without being particularly prolific.",
      "At Son Moix, that profile sharpens. Across their last 3 home matches in all competitions, Mallorca have 2 wins and 1 draw, scoring 1 goal per game and conceding only 0.33. Their shot volume dips slightly to 12.67 attempts and 3.67 on target, with 47% possession, but the defensive stability is striking. Keeping opponents down to a third of a goal per match over that spell has turned home games into controlled, low-scoring contests.",
      "Osasuna’s recent run tells a tougher story. Over their last 6 matches in all competitions they have 1 win, 1 draw and 4 losses, even though their goal figures are level at 1.33 scored and 1.33 conceded per game. They attempt 12.83 shots per match with an impressive 5.17 on target and average 52.17% possession, so the underlying numbers hint at a team that plays with the ball and creates chances but struggles to convert performances into results.",
      "Osasuna’s most recent \"home\" data is less relevant for this trip, but it is still notable that in their last 3 at El Sadar they have 1 win, 1 draw and 1 loss, scoring 1.67 and conceding only 0.33 on average. That suggests defensive potential, yet the picture changes sharply once they leave Pamplona.",
      "In the La Liga table, Mallorca sit 16th after 13 games with 3 wins, 3 draws and 7 losses. They have scored 13 goals, exactly 1 per match, and conceded 20, an average of 1.54 per game, for a goal difference of -7. The numbers point to a side that is often in games but pays a price for the occasional lapse at the back.",
      "Osasuna, in 17th place, are just below them with 3 wins, 2 draws and 8 defeats from 13 league matches. Their attack has been more blunt at league level, with 10 goals at 0.77 per match, while they concede 16 at 1.23 per game for a goal difference of -6. They are slightly tighter defensively than Mallorca in league play, but the lack of scoring power has made their margin for error extremely small.",
      "Mallorca’s broader trends show a team that has grown stubborn, particularly at home. In their last 8 matches in all competitions they have a 50% win rate, with 4.25 shots on goal and 49.38% possession on average. Stretching the sample out, they have lost 20 of their last 40 matches in all competitions, and 50% of their last 40 in La Liga, which underlines how often they are pushed back at top level, but the current shorter run is clearly more positive.",
      "Recent home form is even more encouraging for Javier Aguirre’s side: in their last 6 home games in all competitions, they have drawn 50% and remained undefeated in 83%. The same pattern holds in La Liga at Son Moix, where across the last 6 home league matches they have also drawn 50% and stayed unbeaten in 83%. Set against that, they have been winless in 16 of their last 20 league fixtures overall, a reminder that consistency across all venues is still missing.",
      "Osasuna’s long view is more troubling. In all competitions they have lost 8 of their last 16 matches and been winless in 8 of their last 10. Away from home that difficulty intensifies: across their last 15 away games in all competitions they have lost 53%, and they have been winless in 83% of their last 12 away fixtures. In La Liga, they have lost 50% of their last 18 matches and have been winless in 82% of their last 11 league outings. Those are the figures of a side that often competes but rarely gets over the line.",
      "Interestingly, Osasuna’s home-based league stats are strong, with 5 clean sheets in their last 12 home league matches and 18 wins across their last 36 home league games, staying undefeated in 80% of their last 10 at El Sadar. The problem for this match is that all of that solidity is linked to Pamplona rather than to their travels."

      "Parma and Udinese arrive at the Ennio Tardini with very different stories but a similar sense of unease. Parma, back in Serie A and still adjusting, have turned stalemates into a way of life, while Udinese mix sporadic punches in attack with a defence that can suddenly collapse. This looks less like a glamour showcase and more like a hard-nosed test of who manages risk better over 90 minutes.",
      "Recent meetings in Emilia give a fair idea of how finely balanced this fixture can be. In the last 4 home matches for Parma against Udinese, the Gialloblù have taken 1 win, shared the points twice and lost once. Nothing in that run suggests a one-sided matchup; instead, it underlines how often these games get decided by small details rather than long spells of dominance.",
      "Parma’s broader picture in Serie A is that of a team still finding its attacking edge. Carlos Antón Cuesta’s side sit 15th with 2 wins, 5 draws and 5 defeats from 12 league games, scoring only 9 goals at an average of 0.75 per match while conceding 15 at 1.25 per game. The negative goal difference of -6 is not catastrophic, but it shows how often they are on the wrong side of tight margins.",
      "The recent form numbers are even more cautious. Across their last 6 matches in all competitions, Parma have 1 win, 3 draws and 2 losses, with a modest scoring average of 1 goal and 1.33 conceded. They are not being blown away, but they rarely pull away either. Their attacking volume is low: 9.17 total shots per match, only 3.33 of those on target, and an average possession of 36.67%, which suggests a side more comfortable ceding the ball and trying to be compact.",
      "At home that pattern becomes even clearer. In the last 3 matches at the Tardini, Parma are winless with 0 wins, 2 draws and 1 defeat, scoring an average of 1 goal and conceding 1.67. They actually shoot a bit more at home, 10.33 attempts per match, but only 2.67 reach the target, and possession drops slightly to 35.67%. The historical trends reinforce that picture: in all competitions, Parma have drawn 50% of their last 12 games and have been winless in 85% of their last 13. In Serie A specifically, they have been winless in 83% of their last 30 league fixtures and winless in 83% of their last 40 home league matches, drawing 50% of their last 12 home games in the competition. This is a team that keeps games close, often without turning them into victories.",
      "Udinese arrive with a different kind of volatility. They are higher in the table in 10th place, with 4 wins, 3 draws and 5 losses from their 12 Serie A outings. They score a little more than Parma, 12 league goals at 1 per match, but also concede more, 20 at an average of 1.67 per game, leaving them with a goal difference of -8. That defensive record is where doubts creep in.",
      "Across their last 6 matches in all competitions, Udinese have 2 wins, 1 draw and 3 defeats, averaging 1 goal scored and 1.83 conceded. Their attacking output is similar to Parma’s at 9.5 shots per match and 3.17 on target, but they tend to have more of the ball with 44% average possession. Away from home, however, the flaws show: over their last 12 away fixtures in all competitions they have lost 58%, and in their last 15 away matches they have lost by 2 or more goals in 6. In Serie A overall they have lost 55% of their last 20 league matches, and 38% of their last 13 in all competitions have ended in defeats by at least 2 goals. When things go wrong, they often go badly wrong.",
      "The recent history trends at home for Udinese back that up indirectly: although those are home numbers, they underline inconsistency. They have lost 6 of their last 12 home league games and gone winless in 9 of their last 11 at home in Serie A. Put together with the away record, Udinese look like a side that relies on individual quality spurts more than a stable platform."

      "A meeting between Werder Bremen and Köln at the Wohninvest Weserstadion brings together two Bundesliga sides sharing mid-table positions but with sharply contrasting home and away fortunes. Bremen's strong home record pairs with Köln’s recent struggles on the road, setting up a contest focused on streaks and recovery.",
      "Werder Bremen and Köln have played out tight affairs in Bremen in recent years. In their last 7 meetings at the Wohninvest Weserstadion, Werder Bremen haven't lost, claiming 3 wins and seeing 4 matches end in draws. This consistent ability to avoid defeat on home turf against Köln stretches back multiple seasons and forms the backbone of Bremen's confidence heading into this fixture.",
      "Köln's challenge in Bremen is underscored by this lack of victories, with recent results showing they often leave with a single point rather than all three.",
      "Werder Bremen arrive in decent shape, with 3 wins, 2 draws, and just 1 loss from their last 6 matches across all competitions. Offensively, they are averaging 1.17 goals scored per match in this period, while conceding just 1. Their last 3 home matches have all ended in victory, with a strong defensive showing allowing just 0.33 goals against per match, alongside an uptick in possession and chance creation.",
      "Köln, meanwhile, have struggled recently, winning only once and drawing another over their previous 6 matches, while losing 4. Their defensive issues are clear with 2.33 goals conceded per game during this run, although they are scoring a respectable 1.67 per match. Their last 3 away league games underline their travel issues: only 0.67 goals scored per match, with 1.33 conceded, and possession dipping below 45% in this period.",
      "Through 11 league matches, Werder Bremen hold 9th place with 4 wins, 3 draws, and 4 defeats. They have found the net 15 times, averaging just over a goal per game, but their leaky defense has surrendered 20 goals for a negative goal difference.",
      "Köln sit close behind at 10th, also on 4 wins, but with 2 draws and 5 losses. Their tally of 20 goals scored is counterbalanced by 19 conceded, giving them a slight positive goal difference. Both teams have secured 12 points out of a possible 33, but Bremen’s recent home form stands out as an advantage.",

    "previewText": "A meeting between Werder Bremen and Köln at the Wohninvest Weserstadion brings together two Bundesliga sides sharing mid-table positions but with sharply contrasting home and away fortunes. Bremen's strong home record pairs with Köln’s recent struggles on the road, setting up a contest focused on streaks and recovery.\n\nWerder Bremen and Köln have played out tight affairs in Bremen in recent years. In their last 7 meetings at the Wohninvest Weserstadion, Werder Bremen haven't lost, claiming 3 wins and seeing 4 matches end in draws. This consistent ability to avoid defeat on home turf against Köln stretches back multiple seasons and forms the backbone of Bremen's confidence heading into this fixture.\n\nKöln's challenge in Bremen is underscored by this lack of victories, with recent results showing they often leave with a single point rather than all three.\n\nWerder Bremen arrive in decent shape, with 3 wins, 2 draws, and just 1 loss from their last 6 matches across all competitions. Offensively, they are averaging 1.17 goals scored per match in this period, while conceding just 1. Their last 3 home matches have all ended in victory, with a strong defensive showing allowing just 0.33 goals against per match, alongside an uptick in possession and chance creation.\n\nKöln, meanwhile, have struggled recently, winning only once and drawing another over their previous 6 matches, while losing 4. Their defensive issues are clear with 2.33 goals conceded per game during this run, although they are scoring a respectable 1.67 per match. Their last 3 away league games underline their travel issues: only 0.67 goals scored per match, with 1.33 conceded, and possession dipping below 45% in this period.\n\nThrough 11 league matches, Werder Bremen hold 9th place with 4 wins, 3 draws, and 4 defeats. They have found the net 15 times, averaging just over a goal per game, but their leaky defense has surrendered 20 goals for a negative goal difference.\n\nKöln sit close behind at 10th, also on 4 wins, but with 2 draws and 5 losses. Their tally of 20 goals scored is counterbalanced by 19 conceded, giving them a slight positive goal difference. Both teams have secured 12 points out of a possible 33, but Bremen’s recent home form stands out as an advantage.\n\nBremen have shown resilience at home, going undefeated in 5 of their last 6 matches in all competitions. Over their past 20 Bundesliga home games, they've kept 8 clean sheets and are undefeated in 80% of their last 10 home matches. When facing Köln at home, Bremen have 3 wins and remain unbeaten in their last 7 encounters.

      "Two sides quietly building European ambitions cross paths at the Stadium of Light, as Sunderland and Bournemouth arrive with almost identical records but very different ways of getting there. With both managers leaning into distinct tactical identities and draws dominating their recent trends, this has the feel of a cagey meeting where small details could swing a lot in the Premier League table.",
      "Sunderland’s return to the Premier League has been built on structure and control, and their numbers after 12 rounds back that up. Régis Le Bris has guided his side to 5 wins, 4 draws and 3 losses, with 14 goals scored and only 11 conceded. That average of 0.92 goals against per match is firmly top-half material and has them sitting 7th, just a single place above Bournemouth, who share the same 5-4-3 record but with a very different profile at both ends of the pitch.",
      "The recent history between these two at the Stadium of Light suggests there is not much to separate them. In the last 2 Premier League meetings here, Sunderland have drawn once and lost once, so they have not beaten Bournemouth at home in either of those games. That small sample mirrors what the broader data says: Bournemouth have often found a way to be awkward visitors, even when their overall away form has dipped.",
      "Sunderland’s current form line is balanced. Across their last 6 matches in all competitions they have 2 wins, 2 draws and 2 defeats, scoring 1.17 goals per game and conceding the same 1.17. The underlying numbers tell a story of a compact side happy to play without the ball; they average just 9 total shots and 2.67 shots on target with 43.5% possession. At home, though, they look a little more assertive. In their last 3 at the Stadium of Light they are unbeaten with 1 win and 2 draws, scoring 1.67 and conceding 1 per match, with shots rising to 10.67 per game and possession nudging up to 45.67%.",
      "Those home figures feed into some striking longer-term trends. Sunderland have been undefeated in 25 of their last 30 home matches in all competitions, a superb base that has carried into this Premier League campaign. More broadly, they have not been beaten in 82% of their last 11 matches in all competitions, even if their current streak is slightly less flattering with 3 straight games without a victory. Draws are a recurring theme, with 50% of their last 8 home matches ending level.",
      "Bournemouth arrive with an equally intriguing data profile. Andoni Iraola’s side sit 8th with 19 goals scored and 20 conceded in 12 league games, an average of 1.58 goals for and 1.67 against. In their last 6 matches in all competitions they mirror Sunderland’s record at 2 wins, 2 draws and 2 defeats, but they have been more open, scoring 1.83 and conceding 2.17 per match. Importantly, they generate far more offensive volume, with 13.5 total shots and 5.83 on target per game, backed by 55% average possession.",
      "The story changes when Bournemouth leave the south coast. They are winless in 10 of their last 12 away matches in all competitions and have lost 50% of their last 8 away games. Defensive collapses have been an issue, as they have been beaten by 2 or more goals in 4 of their last 10 away fixtures. That said, Bournemouth have still managed to stay unbeaten in 8 of their last 10 matches overall and 50% of their last 8 games in all competitions have finished level, underlining how often they find a way to share the points.",
      "Recent travel numbers reinforce those concerns. Over Bournemouth’s last 3 away league matches they have 0 wins, 1 draw and 2 defeats, conceding 3.33 goals per game while scoring 1.33. They still fashion chances, with 9.67 shots and 4.67 on target per match, but the defensive vulnerability on the road stands in stark contrast to Sunderland’s long home run of reliability."

The match offers a fresh opportunity for Zürich to avenge a heavy loss just weeks ago and potentially climb the Super League table.",
      "The last encounter between Zürich and Grasshoppers remains fresh in memory, as Grasshoppers triumphed 3-0 at home on October 4, 2025. That evening, Zürich held 59% of the ball and managed 12 attempts, yet it was Grasshoppers who proved clinical. Jonathan Asp Jensen opened the scoring in the 35th minute, Samuel Marques doubled the lead in the 55th, and Nikolas Muci secured victory from the penalty spot in the 82nd minute. Despite Zürich dominating possession and registering 65 dangerous attacks to Grasshoppers' 36, the visitors lacked cutting edge, finding the target with just two shots on goal.",

Out of their last six matches across all competitions, they have managed only one victory, drawn once, and suffered four defeats, scoring 1.33 goals and conceding 2 per game on average. At home, their output improves slightly, averaging two goals per match but also conceding 2.33. Their possession numbers at Stadion Letzigrund remain strong at nearly 60%, and they attempt over 19 shots per match in front of familiar surroundings.",
      "Looking at season performance, Zürich sit 8th in the Super League. After 14 matches, they have claimed five wins, two draws, and seven losses, with a negative goal difference of -6 after conceding 27 goals.",
      "Trends suggest inconsistent form: Zürich have lost 50% of their last 24 matches in all competitions. More recently, they have gone winless in 86% of their last 7 matches in the league. On home soil, results have been split, with an even 50% win rate in both their last 12 home matches in all tournaments and in their last 14 league games at Letzigrund.",
      "Grasshoppers’ season tells a challenging story. They are currently 11th, with just three wins, five draws, and six defeats from their 14 matches. The goal difference sits at -9, with 19 goals scored and 28 conceded, translating to an average of 1.36 goals for and 2 against per game.",

    "previewText": "Zürich prepare to face Grasshoppers at Stadion Letzigrund seeking to overturn the outcome of their previous meeting and get their league campaign back on track. The match offers a fresh opportunity for Zürich to avenge a heavy loss just weeks ago and potentially climb the Super League table.\n\nThe last encounter between Zürich and Grasshoppers remains fresh in memory, as Grasshoppers triumphed 3-0 at home on October 4, 2025. That evening, Zürich held 59% of the ball and managed 12 attempts, yet it was Grasshoppers who proved clinical. Jonathan Asp Jensen opened the scoring in the 35th minute, Samuel Marques doubled the lead in the 55th, and Nikolas Muci secured victory from the penalty spot in the 82nd minute. Despite Zürich dominating possession and registering 65 dangerous attacks to Grasshoppers' 36, the visitors lacked cutting edge, finding the target with just two shots on goal.\n\nZürich’s recent fortunes have been mixed. Out of their last six matches across all competitions, they have managed only one victory, drawn once, and suffered four defeats, scoring 1.33 goals and conceding 2 per game on average. At home, their output improves slightly, averaging two goals per match but also conceding 2.33. Their possession numbers at Stadion Letzigrund remain strong at nearly 60%, and they attempt over 19 shots per match in front of familiar surroundings.\n\nLooking at season performance, Zürich sit 8th in the Super League. After 14 matches, they have claimed five wins, two draws, and seven losses, with a negative goal difference of -6 after conceding 27 goals.\n\nTrends suggest inconsistent form: Zürich have lost 50% of their last 24 matches in all competitions. More recently, they have gone winless in 86% of their last 7 matches in the league. On home soil, results have been split, with an even 50% win rate in both their last 12 home matches in all tournaments and in their last 14 league games at Letzigrund.\n\nGrasshoppers’ season tells a challenging story. They are currently 11th, with just three wins, five draws, and six defeats from their 14 matches. The goal difference sits at -9, with 19 goals scored and 28 conceded, translating to an average of 1.36 goals for and 2 against per game.\n\nRecent form for Grasshoppers is concerning.

Everton have quietly turned Goodison into a difficult place to visit again, while Newcastle arrive still searching for answers on their travels. The balance of power in this one may hinge on whether David Moyes’ compact structure can blunt Eddie Howe’s forward fluency long enough for the hosts’ new-look attack to make the difference.",
      "Everton’s season has been built on solidity first, and the numbers back that up. Twelve league matches have brought 5 wins, 3 draws and 4 defeats, with 13 goals scored and 13 conceded, an almost perfectly balanced profile at 1.08 scored and 1.08 allowed per game. That foundation has helped Moyes’ side sit 11th, and the recent run hints at a team growing into its shape, especially at home.",
      "The last six matches in all competitions show a pragmatic Everton: 3 wins, 1 draw and 2 losses, while averaging just 1 goal scored and 1.17 conceded. They do not flood opponents with attacks, taking 9.33 shots per match with 3 on target and only 42% possession, which speaks to a side comfortable without the ball, prepared to defend deep and pick their moments.",
      "At Goodison, though, the picture shifts. Across the last three home matches in all competitions, Everton have 2 wins and 1 defeat, scoring 1.33 and conceding 1.33 per game, but crucially increasing their attacking volume to 13.33 shots and 4.67 on target with possession climbing to 51.33%. That trend dovetails with broader long term data. They have been undefeated in 82% of their last 17 home games in all competitions and are undefeated in 10 of their last 12 home matches in the Premier League. Half of their last 10 home league matches have ended in victory, and they have managed 3 wins by 2 or more goals in their last 7 league outings at Goodison, suggesting that when they do get on top, they can turn control into clear scorelines.",
      "Newcastle’s overall trajectory under Eddie Howe still looks positive but is being undermined by travel issues. In all competitions over their last 30 matches they have won 53%, with strong attacking metrics at 5.07 shots on target and 51.3% possession. However, the away numbers tell another story. In their last 12 away games in all competitions they have lost 50% and are winless in 83% of those 12 matches. Clean sheets have come in just 5 of those 12, and while they still average close to 4 shots on target and 52% of the ball, the results have not followed.",
      "In the league, Newcastle sit 14th with 4 wins, 3 draws and 5 defeats, also on 13 goals scored but conceding 15 at 1.25 per game. The recent Premier League stretch is patchy: 3 wins and 3 losses in their last 6, reflecting a side capable of high peaks yet vulnerable when stretched. Their last 6 in all competitions mirror that streak: 3 wins and 3 defeats, scoring 1.5 and conceding 1.5 per match.",
      "The direct recent history slightly favours Newcastle. Over the last 10 meetings, Everton have 3 wins, Newcastle 5, with 2 draws. But Goodison has not been an unhappy hunting ground for the hosts in this fixture. Everton have won 2 of their last 4 home matches against Newcastle and, in their last 5 home clashes, Newcastle have twice lost by 2 or more goals. That points to a pattern where, despite Newcastle’s recent superiority overall, Goodison can tilt the tie back toward the Merseyside club."

Auxerre have also lost by two or more goals in two of their last three matches against Paris FC, suggesting the hosts have found ways to punish them recently.\n\nOn the season as a whole, Paris FC currently occupy 12th in the standings with four wins, two draws, and seven losses after 13 games, averaging 1.54 goals scored and 1.92 conceded per game. Auxerre linger down in 18th, with just two wins, two draws, and nine losses, and a meager seven goals scored to 19 conceded in the league campaign so far.",

      "Milan come into this clash carrying the rhythm of a side that knows how to manage games. Massimiliano Allegri’s team is on a 12 match undefeated run in all competitions, and has not been beaten in 83% of its last 23 Serie A fixtures. That level of consistency has underpinned their rise to second place, with 7 wins, 4 draws and just 1 defeat from 12 league matches, and a goal difference of +9 built on control rather than chaos.",
      "Recent games between these two sides suggests there is little to separate them on the day. In the last 3 meetings in all competitions, Milan have taken 1 win, Lazio have 1 win, and there has been 1 draw. However, when the venue shifts to San Siro the balance tilts. Milan have won 62% of their last 13 home matches against Lazio, and in 4 of the last 6 home meetings they have won by at least 2 goals, pointing to a pattern where Milan’s structure and wide threats tend to stretch the visitors more than in Rome.",
      "Allegri’s current Milan, though, are not living off historical dominance. Their recent form backs up their league position. Over the last 6 matches in all competitions they have 3 wins and 3 draws, scoring an average of 1.5 goals and conceding 1. At home they look even more assured: in the last 3 games at San Siro they have 2 wins and 1 draw, scoring 1.67 goals per match and conceding 1, while averaging 16.67 total shots and 6.33 shots on target. Those numbers describe a side that regularly creates enough to edge tight contests, even if it rarely runs away with them.",
      "Longer term trends strongly favour Milan in front of their own posts. They have been undefeated in 80% of their last 15 home matches in all competitions and kept clean sheets in 42% of their last 12 at San Siro. In the league, they have won 10 of their last 20 home Serie A games and stayed undefeated in 12 of their last 15. Combine that with a 39% rate of wins by 2 or more goals across their last 23 matches in all competitions, and it is clear why Milan are viewed as one of the most reliable home performers in Italy.",

That defensive resilience is further highlighted by an average of 10.5 shots per game and 4.5 on target, suggesting measured attacking play rather than full throttle football.",

      "When Shonan Bellmare meet Shimizu S-Pulse at Lemon Gas Stadium Hiratsuka on 30 November 2025, both teams will be looking to close their regular J1 League campaign on a positive note. With the sides sharing remarkably similar recent numbers and no bragging rights secured in their last face-off, another closely-matched fixture appears on the cards.",
      "The previous meeting between Shonan Bellmare and Shimizu S-Pulse, held on 16 July 2025, ended in a goalless draw. Bellmare might have felt unfortunate not to snatch the win, as they registered 19 shots, 7 on target, and 55% possession. Their 42 dangerous attacks proved persistent, but the breakthrough never materialized.",
      "Meanwhile, Shimizu S-Pulse produced 10 shots, 4 on target, with 45% possession and 33 dangerous attacks. Although their numbers lagged slightly behind, S-Pulse matched Bellmare's tenacity in defense, making for a well-balanced contest throughout.",
      "Shonan Bellmare come into this match with only a single win in their previous six games, along with one draw and four defeats. Their scoring average sits at 1.17 goals per match while conceding 1.33, and their overall recent play reflects modest attacking intent with an average of 11.17 shots per outing.",
      "Their home form is mixed: one win, one draw, and one defeat, with a promising average of 5 shots on target per match but only 2 goals scored. Possession at home, at 45%, highlights a slight struggle to consistently dictate play on their own turf.",
      "Shimizu S-Pulse share strikingly parallel fortunes. Over their last six games, they've also won just once, drawing twice and losing thrice. Scoring at the same 1.17 goals-per-match rate but conceding 2 goals on average, S-Pulse have been let down by a leaky defense. Their shot generation is fractionally better at 12.33 per match, but attacking conversion remains inconsistent.",
      "On away soil, S-Pulse have struggled, losing twice in their last three. They average 11.67 shots per match and 46% possession in those games, conceding 2.33 goals per fixture.",
      "Shonan Bellmare's campaign has placed them 19th in the J1 League, managing 7 wins, 8 draws, and 21 losses from 36 outings. A negative goal difference of -27 underlines difficulties at both ends, with just 34 goals for and 61 conceded (0.94 scored, 1.69 conceded per match).",
      "Shimizu S-Pulse sit in 13th with 11 victories, 11 draws, and 14 losses. They have scored 40 and let in 48 across their 36 games, which results in a less alarming -8 goal difference. Their attack yields 1.11 goals per game, demonstrating a marginally sharper edge up front than Bellmare.",
      "For Shonan Bellmare, difficult spells have heavily influenced their campaign. They have lost 73% of their last 15 matches in all competitions, and have remained winless in 18 of their previous 20. This trend extends to home games, where they've gone winless in 11 of 12, with draws coming in half of their last 10.",
      "Their recent record against Shimizu S-Pulse shows balance: five draws in the last ten meetings. However, home fixtures against S-Pulse saw 43% of the last seven lost by 2 or more goals.",
      "S-Pulse themselves have not found away points easy to come by, remaining winless in 11 of their last 13 trips. Defensive solidity has sometimes helped, with clean sheets in 40% of their last 15 away games, but three defeats from their past six league matches signal vulnerability."

      "Lecce and Torino arrive at the Via del Mare with very different worries but a similar identity: both are hard to break down, both live on narrow margins, and both have been sharing the points a lot more than they would like. With one side edging dangerously close to the relegation places and the other still searching for rhythm in mid‑table, this shapes up less as a spectacle and more as a tactical arm‑wrestle for precious ground in Serie A.",
      "Lecce’s season has slowly drifted towards the danger zone, and this meeting with Torino feels like one of those matches that can nudge a campaign either into deeper trouble or back towards calmer waters. Eusebio Di Francesco’s side sits 17th after 12 games, with only 2 wins, 4 draws and 6 losses, and a goal difference of -8. The numbers tell the story of a group that competes but struggles badly in the final third.",
      "In the league, Lecce average just 0.67 goals per game, scoring 8 and conceding 16. Over their last 6 matches in all competitions they have 1 win, 2 draws and 3 defeats, while scoring 0.5 and conceding 1 goal per match on average. That combination of low scoring and narrow losses fits neatly with their wider trend in Serie A: they have lost 53% of their last 30 league fixtures and have been winless in 32 of their last 40 league games. The margins are always tight, but the points return is thin.",
      "The home numbers add another layer. Lecce are winless in 18 of their last 20 Serie A home matches and have lost 10 of those 20, which underlines why every fixture in Salento now carries real weight. On the positive side, they have kept 3 clean sheets in their last 7 home league games and 4 in their last 10 home matches in all competitions, which suggests the defensive structure is competent. In their last 3 home games in all competitions, they have not scored at all but conceded only 0.33 per match, with 0 wins, 2 draws and 1 loss.",
      "Head to head at the Via del Mare, Lecce have found it difficult against Torino in recent years. In the last 3 home meetings with the Granata they have 1 win and 2 defeats. Even more telling is a broader trend: in their last 7 matches against Torino in all competitions, Lecce have lost by 2 or more goals in 43% of them. That profile hints at a stylistic problem when facing this opponent: when it goes wrong for Lecce in this fixture, it can go wrong quickly.",
      "Torino, coached by Marco Baroni, occupy 12th place with 3 wins, 5 draws and 4 defeats from 12 league games. Curiously, despite sitting higher than Lecce, they have an even worse goal difference of -10, scoring 11 (0.92 per match) and conceding 21 (1.75 per match). Their recent form in all competitions, though, is steadier: over the last 6 games they have 2 wins, 3 draws and just 1 loss, scoring 1 and conceding 1.33 per match. They have been undefeated in 6 of those 7 latest outings, mirroring their Serie A trend where they are undefeated in 86% of their last 7 league matches.",
      "Draws are a recurring theme for Torino. They have drawn 4 of their last 8 matches in all competitions and 50% of their last 8 Serie A games. Away from home the picture is mixed: they have lost 5 of their last 10 away matches in all competitions and are winless in 87% of their last 15 away fixtures. Yet they have also kept clean sheets in 43% of their last 7 away games, suggesting that while victories are scarce, they frequently manage to drag matches into low scoring territory.",
      "From a statistical perspective this encounter leans strongly towards a tight scoreline. Lecce’s home attack has completely dried up in the short term, and their overall chance creation is modest, with 9.67 total shots and 3 shots on target per match over their last 6 games, and an average possession of 46%. Torino, meanwhile, allow the ball, averaging 40.83% possession in that same 6‑match sample but still producing 10.83 shots and 3 on target. The pattern points towards Torino sitting compact, Lecce trying to carry the territorial initiative and both sides relying on set pieces and transitions rather than free‑flowing attacks."

    "previewText": "Lecce and Torino arrive at the Via del Mare with very different worries but a similar identity: both are hard to break down, both live on narrow margins, and both have been sharing the points a lot more than they would like. With one side edging dangerously close to the relegation places and the other still searching for rhythm in mid‑table, this shapes up less as a spectacle and more as a tactical arm‑wrestle for precious ground in Serie A.\n\nLecce’s season has slowly drifted towards the danger zone, and this meeting with Torino feels like one of those matches that can nudge a campaign either into deeper trouble or back towards calmer waters. Eusebio Di Francesco’s side sits 17th after 12 games, with only 2 wins, 4 draws and 6 losses, and a goal difference of -8. The numbers tell the story of a group that competes but struggles badly in the final third.\n\nIn the league, Lecce average just 0.67 goals per game, scoring 8 and conceding 16. Over their last 6 matches in all competitions they have 1 win, 2 draws and 3 defeats, while scoring 0.5 and conceding 1 goal per match on average. That combination of low scoring and narrow losses fits neatly with their wider trend in Serie A: they have lost 53% of their last 30 league fixtures and have been winless in 32 of their last 40 league games. The margins are always tight, but the points return is thin.\n\nThe home numbers add another layer. Lecce are winless in 18 of their last 20 Serie A home matches and have lost 10 of those 20, which underlines why every fixture in Salento now carries real weight. On the positive side, they have kept 3 clean sheets in their last 7 home league games and 4 in their last 10 home matches in all competitions, which suggests the defensive structure is competent. In their last 3 home games in all competitions, they have not scored at all but conceded only 0.33 per match, with 0 wins, 2 draws and 1 loss.\n\nHead to head at the Via del Mare, Lecce have found it difficult against Torino in recent years. In the last 3 home meetings with the Granata they have 1 win and 2 defeats. Even more telling is a broader trend: in their last 7 matches against Torino in all competitions, Lecce have lost by 2 or more goals in 43% of them. That profile hints at a stylistic problem when facing this opponent: when it goes wrong for Lecce in this fixture, it can go wrong quickly.\n\nTorino, coached by Marco Baroni, occupy 12th place with 3 wins, 5 draws and 4 defeats from 12 league games. Curiously, despite sitting higher than Lecce, they have an even worse goal difference of -10, scoring 11 (0.92 per match) and conceding 21 (1.75 per match). Their recent form in all competitions, though, is steadier: over the last 6 games they have 2 wins, 3 draws and just 1 loss, scoring 1 and conceding 1.33 per match.

With Palace riding a strong league run and United leaning on their attack to keep pace, this looks less like a routine trip for a traditional giant and more like a genuine top half battle.",
      "Crystal Palace arrive in this clash with the profile of a quietly efficient top side. Fifth in the Premier League after 12 matches, Glasner’s team have collected 5 wins, 5 draws and only 2 defeats, with a goal difference of +7. The numbers paint a clear picture: they score 1.33 goals per league game and concede just 0.75, a balance that puts them firmly in the conversation for European places rather than just mid-table comfort.",
      "Manchester United, under Ruben Amorim, sit in 10th with 5 wins, 3 draws and 4 losses from the same number of matches. They find the net more often than Palace at 1.58 goals per league game, but also concede at the same 1.58 rate, leaving a neutral goal difference of 0. It underlines the contrast between these sides so far: Palace are built around control and defensive structure, United around a more volatile attacking edge.",
      "The recent history between the two at Selhurst Park leans slightly towards the hosts. In the last three meetings in south London, Palace have 1 win and 2 draws with no defeats. Stretch that view further and Palace have drawn 3 of their last 5 home encounters against United, showing they have largely removed the aura that once surrounded this fixture from a home perspective.",
      "Palace’s broader trends reinforce that impression. In all competitions they have won 50% of their last 26 matches and have been undefeated in 83% of their last 30. At home in all competitions, they have also won 50% of their last 26 and remain particularly solid in league play, where they have stayed unbeaten in 32 of their last 40 Premier League fixtures. At Selhurst in the league, they have not lost in 87% of their last 15 home matches and have kept clean sheets in 42% of their last 12, a foundation that makes them notably difficult to break down.",
      "Recent form backs that up. Across their last 6 matches in all competitions, Palace have 4 wins, 1 draw and just 1 loss, conceding only 0.33 goals per game while scoring 1.67. They are not dominant in possession, averaging 41.33% of the ball, but they use it efficiently. Over those same 6 games they have averaged 11.67 total shots and 4.17 on target. At home, the figures are even stronger: 2 wins and 1 draw from their last 3 matches, with 1.67 goals scored and 0.33 conceded on average, plus a slightly higher shot volume at 13.33 attempts per match.",

Over their last 6 matches in all competitions they have 3 wins, 2 draws and 1 defeat, scoring 2 goals per game while conceding 1.33. They typically see more of the ball than Palace, with 50.67% average possession, and generate 14.67 shots per match, 5.67 of them on target. However, there is a note of concern away from home: in their last 20 away matches in all competitions they have been winless in 80% of them, and across their last 10 away fixtures they have lost 5. They have drawn 4 of their last 8 on the road, so stalemates are a recurring theme.",

They are scoring 2.17 goals per game and conceding only 1 on average, numbers that underline a balanced team capable of creating chances while keeping games under control.",

In their last 3 home matches in all competitions, Real Sociedad have 2 wins and 1 loss, averaging 1.67 goals scored and 1.33 conceded. Interestingly, those home performances have come with lower attacking volume than away from home, with only 8 total shots and 3.67 on target per match compared to 13.83 and 6.33 overall. That suggests a more cautious approach in San Sebastián, focused on control rather than sheer shot volume.",

Their attack has been particularly sharp, averaging 2 goals per game, while the defence allows only 0.85, delivering a strong +15 goal difference. Across all competitions, they have won 11 of their last 20 matches and in the league they have won 15 of their last 20, remaining undefeated in 25 of their last 30 La Liga fixtures. This is a sustained run rather than a short spike.",

Villarreal have also had some emphatic days here, with Real Sociedad losing by 2 or more goals in 2 of the last 5 head to head matches. For Francisco’s team, then, this fixture carries a hint of a psychological test: they are in strong form, yet Villarreal have often found a way to hurt them.",

Their attacking output has been limited—just one goal scored over those matches—while conceding over two per outing on average. Possession has been an issue as well, dropping to just 35% in away fixtures.\n\nThe head-to-head history at Stade de la Meinau offers a mixed picture. Over the last five meetings in Strasbourg, the hosts have claimed just one win, with two matches ending in draws and Brest claiming two victories. This suggests that, despite Strasbourg’s current form, Brest has found ways to disrupt them in past encounters on this ground.\n\nAcross the broader campaign, Strasbourg are enjoying a productive start. Sitting in fifth with 24 goals from 13 matches, they carry a strong attacking threat (1.85 goals per game on average) and have kept goals against to just over 1.3 per match. Their home record in the Ligue 1 is particularly notable, having gone undefeated in 23 of their last 28 league matches at Stade de la Meinau and winning 60% of the last 30.\n\nBrest’s struggles are reflected in the standings, currently lying in 14th. They have just three wins from 13 matches and have lost half of their last 12 encounters in all competitions. On the road, the difficulties compound: winless in 85% of their last 13 away games, and defeated by two or more goals in 40% of their last 20 trips. Defensive stability has been elusive, with 23 goals conceded across the season.",

      "Two very different Premier League stories intersect at the City Ground, where Sean Dyche’s hard-edged Nottingham Forest try to stretch an unbeaten run against a Brighton side that quietly lurks around the European places. With Forest edging away from trouble and Brighton pushing toward the top six, this meeting looks less like a mismatch and more like a test of which identity holds up under pressure: Dyche’s compact structure or Fabian Hürzeler’s expansive, possession-heavy approach.",
      "Nottingham Forest arrive in this one with a sense of growing stability. Under Sean Dyche they have become harder to break down, and the numbers over their last 6 matches in all competitions tell that story: 3 wins, 2 draws and just 1 defeat, scoring 1.67 goals and conceding only 0.83 per game. That run includes a 4 match unbeaten streak, and at the City Ground their last 3 home fixtures have brought 2 wins and a draw with 2.33 goals scored on average. It is a clear uptick for a side that has often struggled for consistency.",
      "Brighton, meanwhile, continue to look like one of the league’s more polished outfits. They sit 6th in the Premier League with 5 wins, 4 draws and 3 losses from 12 games, backed by a positive goal difference of +3 and 1.58 goals scored per match. Across their last 6 outings in all competitions they mirror Forest’s win tally with 3 victories, 1 draw and 2 defeats, but their attacking metrics are stronger: 13.83 total shots per match and 5.17 on target, combined with an average 54.17% share of the ball. That blend of volume and control underpins their push for European qualification.",
      "The most recent encounter between these sides offers an intriguing reference point. In March, Brighton hosted Forest and the match finished 0-0, yet the scoreline did not reflect a dull stalemate. Both teams produced 14 total shots. Forest actually managed more efforts on target, 5 to Brighton’s 2, while Brighton edged possession 53% to 47%. Dangerous attacks were finely balanced too, with Forest registering 61 to Brighton’s 58. The picture was of two sides evenly matched, Forest comfortable ceding a little of the ball but carrying a clear threat on transitions, and Brighton probing patiently without finding a way through a well-organised block.",
      "Context around that goalless draw matters. Brighton followed familiar patterns by controlling the ball and territory, but Forest showed they can live with that style. Dyche’s side restricted clear opportunities, kept their defensive shape and still carved enough moments of danger to suggest that with sharper finishing, the outcome could easily have swung their way. That defensive resilience, now reinforced by their current unbeaten streak of 4 in all competitions, gives them a platform to challenge a top six opponent.",
      "Over the larger league sample, however, Brighton hold the edge. Forest are 16th in the Premier League with 3 wins, 3 draws and 6 defeats from 12 matches, scoring 13 and conceding 20. They have lost 10 of their last 20 league games and have been winless in 9 of their last 11 in the competition. There is also a vulnerability to heavy defeats, with Forest losing by 2 or more goals in 42% of their last 12 Premier League outings. By contrast, Brighton have won 50% of their last 30 league fixtures and have avoided defeat in 82% of their last 17 Premier League matches, a level of consistency that underlines why they are chasing European places rather than survival.",
      "The home trends at the City Ground are mixed. Forest have won 50% of their last 22 home league matches, but they have been winless in 8 of their last 10 at home in the Premier League and have lost half of their last 12 league games there. That suggests a side capable of strong performances on their own pitch, but also one prone to swings in form. Brighton’s broader pattern away from home is steadier; across all competitions they have been very competitive on their travels, winning by 2 or more goals in 5 of their last 13 away matches, which points to the potential for them to turn control of games into decisive scorelines.",
      "Tactically, both managers are likely to retain their preferred 4-2-3-1 structure. Forest’s recent lineups have been remarkably consistent, with Matz Sels an ever-present in goal and a settled back four. Dyche’s team typically accept a lower share of possession, averaging 44.83% over their last 6 matches, but compensate with compact spacing and clear defensive roles. Their 11.83 shots per game and 4.17 on target in that span show they are not passive; instead, they aim for efficient use of the ball and direct progression through the lines once possession is won.",
      "Brighton under Fabian Hürzeler lean even further into controlled build-up. Their last 6 matches in all competitions bring higher possession and more shots on goal, and their midfield pairing around Carlos Baleba has been central to that. They tend to create overloads in wide and half spaces, seeking to free their attacking midfielders between the lines. The risk for them at the City Ground is clear: push too many bodies forward and Forest have the pace and direct running to exploit transitions, especially through players like Morgan Gibbs-White pulling strings behind the striker."

With Tromsø eager to secure a top-two finish and Kristiansund battling towards the lower end of the standings, both sides have plenty to play for as they meet again after a dramatic September fixture.\n\nThe last contest between these two teams took place on September 24, 2025, in Tromsø. It was a match that saw the hosts take a two-goal lead through D. Braut, who netted twice in the first half (25th and 38th minutes).\n\nKristiansund showed resilience, pulling a goal back late in stoppage time courtesy of L. Alvheim in the 90th minute. The match ended 2-1 to Tromsø, a result that allowed them to stay in the title hunt. Kristiansund's push for an equalizer fell just short, as they failed to convert their late surge into points.\n\nKristiansund have shown inconsistency in their last 6 matches, picking up 2 wins, 2 draws and 2 defeats. Their attacking output stands at 1.67 goals scored per game with 2 conceded and an average of just under 40% possession.\n\nAt home, Kristiansund's form improves slightly, with 2 wins from their last 3 matches and an increased shot-on-goal average of 5 per game. Defensively, they've still averaged conceding 1.67 goals per home game over that stretch.\n\nTromsø have posted 3 wins and 3 losses in their previous 6 outings, but their numbers are strong: 1.5 goals scored, 1.17 conceded, and a commanding 54.33% possession. Away from home, Tromsø's last 3 outings have seen them win once and lose twice, averaging 1 goal scored and 1.33 conceded per match—but notably achieving a high volume of total shots and over 55% possession on their travels.\n\nKristiansund currently occupy 13th position in the table after 29 games. Their campaign registers 9 wins, 8 draws and 12 losses, with a negative goal difference of -20 as they've given up 56 goals while tallying 36 (1.24 scored, 1.93 conceded per game).\n\nTromsø, by contrast, sit 3rd and are chasing a lofty finish. Over 29 matches, they've secured 17 wins, drawn 3 and lost 9, scoring 47 and conceding 35 for a healthy +12 goal difference (1.62 scored, 1.21 conceded per game).\n\nKristiansund have found wins scarce in recent months, failing to record a victory in 16 out of their last 20 matches in all competitions. They have lost half of their last 10 matches, and 40% of their last 15 Eliteserien fixtures by a margin of at least 2 goals.\n\nStill, there is resilience at home where they're undefeated in 8 of their last 10 league matches. Tromsø have six league wins from their last twelve fixtures (58%) and have won by 2 or more goals in 4 of their latest 10 league games. On the road, they're victorious in half of their last 18 away trips and have lost 4 of their last 8. Tromsø also hold 7 clean sheets from their most recent 15 league home games.",

      "Two teams moving in opposite directions meet at Vefa Stadı, where Fatih Karagümrük’s fight to climb away from the drop zone runs straight into a Besiktas side that has quietly pieced together one of the more solid away records in the division.",
      "On paper this looks like a clash of different ambitions. Fatih Karagümrük sit 18th in the Süper Lig with just 2 wins from 13, while Besiktas arrive in the top half, 7th, and eyeing the European places. The contrast is not just in the table but in the underlying numbers that have shaped both campaigns so far.",
      "Karagümrük’s league record of 2 wins, 2 draws and 9 losses, with 13 goals scored and 24 conceded, tells the story of a side that has struggled to put together complete performances. An average of 1 goal scored per game against 1.85 conceded leaves very little margin for error. Across their last 20 matches in all competitions they have lost 12 and have been winless in 80% of their last 15 games, a sequence that has gradually dragged confidence and consistency down.",
      "Even at home, where Vefa Stadı is supposed to give them an edge, the numbers are mixed. Over their last 32 home matches in all competitions they have still managed to win 50%, and they have kept a clean sheet in 40% of their last 35 home fixtures. However, more recent trends are worrying: they have lost 50% of their last 10 home games and have been winless in 7 of their last 8 at Vefa Stadı. Losing by 2 or more goals in 43% of their last 7 home matches suggests that when they are beaten, the scoreline can quickly get away from them.",
      "The head to head history at this ground does not offer much comfort either. In the last 3 home matches against Besiktas, Karagümrük have 0 wins, 1 draw and 2 defeats. Across the last 5 meetings with Besiktas in all venues they have lost 4 times. For a team already under pressure, that recent history underlines just how tall the task is.",
      "Current form metrics highlight similar concerns. In their last 6 matches in all competitions, Karagümrük have 1 win, 2 draws and 3 losses, scoring only 1 goal per game on average while conceding 1.33. They have averaged 11.83 total shots and 3.17 on target, with just 43% possession. At home in their last 3 games they have been slightly more proactive, posting 11 shots and 3.67 on target with 44.67% possession, and splitting those games evenly with 1 win, 1 draw and 1 defeat. Even so, the lack of cutting edge in the final third remains a theme.",
      "Besiktas, by contrast, look much more balanced. Seventh place with 6 wins, 3 draws and 4 defeats from 13 matches, and a goal difference of +5, reflects a side that is competitive in most fixtures. They have scored 22 league goals at a rate of 1.69 per game and conceded 17 at 1.31 per game. In all competitions they have won 19 of their last 38 matches, and their away numbers are particularly strong: 6 most recent away games have produced a 50% win rate, and they have been undefeated in 12 of their last 15 away fixtures. Winning by 2 or more goals in 38% of their last 13 away matches shows they often travel with real attacking intent.",
      "Recent form backs that up. Over their last 6 matches in all competitions, Besiktas have 2 wins, 2 draws and 2 losses, scoring 1.67 goals per game and conceding 1.33. They average 12.67 total shots and 4 on target with 50.83% possession, figures that point to a side comfortable on the ball and capable of creating chances consistently. Their last 3 home matches have been strong too, with 2 wins and 1 draw, 2 goals scored and only 0.67 conceded on average, underlining a team that has tightened up at the back.",
      "Team news could play a role in how both coaches approach this one. Karagümrük are without Sam Larsson, Nikoloz Ugrekhelidze, Ahmet Sivri and Berke Can Evli. That removes one of their wide creators in Larsson and thins their attacking depth on the bench. Given the last three lineups, a familiar 4-2-3-1 looks likely, with the emphasis on stability in midfield and service to a lone striker."

      "Two sides trapped in long winless stretches meet in Bergamo with similar problems but different approaches. Atalanta keep the ball but struggle to turn control into goals, while Fiorentina are chasing their first league win of the season despite regular flashes of danger in the final third. The numbers suggest a match decided by small details rather than sweeping dominance.",
      "Atalanta against Fiorentina brings together two teams whose seasons have drifted into the same current: plenty of effort, a lot of control in phases, but not enough victories. Raffaele Palladino’s Atalanta sit mid table, drawing more than they win, while Paolo Vanoli’s Fiorentina arrive in serious trouble near the bottom, still searching for that elusive first Serie A success of the campaign.",
      "The most recent chapter between these sides came in Florence on 30 March 2025, when Fiorentina edged a 1-0 home win. The match was tighter than the score suggests. Atalanta actually saw more of the ball with 55% possession and produced 39 dangerous attacks compared to Fiorentina’s 20, but crucially failed to register a single shot on target from 10 attempts. Fiorentina, with 12 shots and 4 on goal, made their efficiency count. Moise Kean struck just before half time, finishing in the 45th minute, and that solitary goal decided a contest where Atalanta looked structurally solid but blunt in the penalty area. That pattern – territorial control without a cutting edge – still hangs over the Bergamo side.",
      "In Serie A, Atalanta’s numbers underline their status as draw specialists. After 12 league matches they are 13th, with 2 wins, 7 draws and 3 losses. They have scored 14 and conceded 14, an average of 1.17 scored and 1.17 allowed per match, reflecting a side that tends to keep things balanced rather than chaotic. The goal difference of 0 mirrors the table: steady, but far from convincing.",
      "Fiorentina, by contrast, sit 19th and are yet to win in 12 league outings. Their record of 0 wins, 6 draws and 6 defeats is stark, as is a goal difference of -9. They score 0.83 goals per game on average (10 in total) and concede 1.58 (19 in total). While they occasionally show attacking promise, they have been punished regularly at the other end, and their inability to turn tight games into wins explains their position more than any dramatic collapses.",
      "Atalanta’s last 6 matches in all competitions read 1 win, 2 draws and 3 losses, with just 0.67 goals scored and 1.5 conceded per game. They still generate chances, averaging 13 total shots and 2.83 on target, helped by a strong average possession of 58.67%. At home in their last 3, they have 0 wins, 2 draws and 1 defeat, scoring only 0.33 goals and conceding 1.33. Interestingly, those Gewiss Stadium games show an even higher volume of attempts, with 17.67 shots and 3.33 on target on average, plus 60% possession, hinting that the finishing rather than chance creation is the main issue.",
      "Fiorentina’s last 6 in all competitions show 0 wins, 3 draws and 3 losses, scoring 1 goal per game and conceding 1.83. They attempt 12.33 shots, with 3.67 on target, and hold 51% possession on average. Away from home they have struggled for a long period; in their last 8 away matches in all competitions they have been winless in 88%, drawing 4 and losing 4. Even so, their away defensive work is not entirely fragile, with 40% clean sheets across their last 10 away games, which supports the idea of low scoring battles rather than open shootouts.",
      "Atalanta’s statistical profile is unusual. Across their last 12 matches in all competitions, 50% have ended level.

Despite a recent slump, they have been robust over the longer term, remaining undefeated in 32 of their last 40 Serie A matches.

    "previewText": "Two sides trapped in long winless stretches meet in Bergamo with similar problems but different approaches. Atalanta keep the ball but struggle to turn control into goals, while Fiorentina are chasing their first league win of the season despite regular flashes of danger in the final third. The numbers suggest a match decided by small details rather than sweeping dominance.\n\nAtalanta against Fiorentina brings together two teams whose seasons have drifted into the same current: plenty of effort, a lot of control in phases, but not enough victories. Raffaele Palladino’s Atalanta sit mid table, drawing more than they win, while Paolo Vanoli’s Fiorentina arrive in serious trouble near the bottom, still searching for that elusive first Serie A success of the campaign.\n\nThe most recent chapter between these sides came in Florence on 30 March 2025, when Fiorentina edged a 1-0 home win. The match was tighter than the score suggests. Atalanta actually saw more of the ball with 55% possession and produced 39 dangerous attacks compared to Fiorentina’s 20, but crucially failed to register a single shot on target from 10 attempts. Fiorentina, with 12 shots and 4 on goal, made their efficiency count. Moise Kean struck just before half time, finishing in the 45th minute, and that solitary goal decided a contest where Atalanta looked structurally solid but blunt in the penalty area. That pattern – territorial control without a cutting edge – still hangs over the Bergamo side.\n\nIn Serie A, Atalanta’s numbers underline their status as draw specialists. After 12 league matches they are 13th, with 2 wins, 7 draws and 3 losses. They have scored 14 and conceded 14, an average of 1.17 scored and 1.17 allowed per match, reflecting a side that tends to keep things balanced rather than chaotic. The goal difference of 0 mirrors the table: steady, but far from convincing.\n\nFiorentina, by contrast, sit 19th and are yet to win in 12 league outings. Their record of 0 wins, 6 draws and 6 defeats is stark, as is a goal difference of -9. They score 0.83 goals per game on average (10 in total) and concede 1.58 (19 in total). While they occasionally show attacking promise, they have been punished regularly at the other end, and their inability to turn tight games into wins explains their position more than any dramatic collapses.\n\nAtalanta’s last 6 matches in all competitions read 1 win, 2 draws and 3 losses, with just 0.67 goals scored and 1.5 conceded per game. They still generate chances, averaging 13 total shots and 2.83 on target, helped by a strong average possession of 58.67%. At home in their last 3, they have 0 wins, 2 draws and 1 defeat, scoring only 0.33 goals and conceding 1.33. Interestingly, those Gewiss Stadium games show an even higher volume of attempts, with 17.67 shots and 3.33 on target on average, plus 60% possession, hinting that the finishing rather than chance creation is the main issue.\n\nFiorentina’s last 6 in all competitions show 0 wins, 3 draws and 3 losses, scoring 1 goal per game and conceding 1.83. They attempt 12.33 shots, with 3.67 on target, and hold 51% possession on average. Away from home they have struggled for a long period; in their last 8 away matches in all competitions they have been winless in 88%, drawing 4 and losing 4. Even so, their away defensive work is not entirely fragile, with 40% clean sheets across their last 10 away games, which supports the idea of low scoring battles rather than open shootouts.\n\nAtalanta’s statistical profile is unusual. Across their last 12 matches in all competitions, 50% have ended level. In the league, the draw theme is even stronger: they have drawn 50% of their last 14 Serie A games. Despite a recent slump, they have been robust over the longer term, remaining undefeated in 32 of their last 40 Serie A matches. Yet within that, there is a prolonged dry spell: they have been winless in 11 of their last 13 league encounters.

      "Celta Vigo and Espanyol arrive at Balaídos with contrasting league positions but remarkably similar recent momentum, setting up a finely balanced contest between a side that draws often and one that has quietly climbed the table through narrow wins.",
      "On paper, 13th against 6th looks straightforward, yet the underlying numbers around Celta Vigo and Espanyol tell a much more nuanced story. Celta are drawing their way through La Liga, while Espanyol have turned small margins into points, and that contrast in styles is likely to shape the pattern of this clash.",
      "The direct meetings between these clubs have rarely been one-sided. Across the last 10 matches in all competitions between Celta Vigo and Espanyol, Celta have taken 2 wins, 5 draws and 3 losses. That means Celta have avoided defeat in 7 of those 10 games, but have only converted that into 2 victories, underlining how often this pairing has produced tight, tactical contests rather than clear-cut outcomes.",
      "More recently, Espanyol have found ways to trouble Celta. Celta have lost 2 of their last 4 matches against Espanyol, and in their last 5 meetings they have been beaten by a margin of 2 or more goals twice. It is a small but telling shift: historically the matchup has been even, yet Espanyol’s recent trips into this fixture show a growing capacity to land decisive blows when chances appear.",
      "Celta’s broad form in all competitions is quietly strong. Over their last 6 matches they have recorded 5 wins and 1 loss, scoring an average of 2.17 goals and conceding 1.17. They are averaging 12.67 total shots per game, with 5 on target, and holding 52.17% possession. That profile suggests a team increasingly comfortable on the ball and efficient in front of goal, with Claudio Giráldez finding a workable balance between structure and creativity.",
      "At Balaídos, however, the picture is more mixed. In their last 3 home matches in all competitions, Celta have 1 win, 1 draw and 1 defeat, scoring 1.67 and conceding 2 per game on average. Their shot volume dips slightly to 11.33 attempts and 3.33 on target, while possession drops to 48.67%. That drop in dominance at home mirrors longer-term patterns, where Celta’s home record has been patchy despite solid overall form.",
      "Espanyol’s recent run is similarly positive. Across their last 6 matches in all competitions, they have 4 wins and 2 losses, scoring 1.33 goals per game and conceding 1. They are generating 14.33 shots per match with 5 on target and averaging 43.83% possession. José González Álvarez has shaped a side that does not need to monopolise the ball to dictate outcomes, thriving instead on compact structure and well-timed transitions.",
      "While their most recent numbers cited focus on home fixtures, the overall pattern is clear: Espanyol’s shot volume and defensive stability travel well, even if their away record over a longer sample has been inconsistent.",
      "In La Liga, Celta’s league table position does not fully reflect their competitiveness. They sit 13th with 3 wins, 7 draws and 3 defeats from 13 matches, scoring 16 goals and conceding 18. That is 1.23 goals scored and 1.38 conceded per game, for a goal difference of -2. The 7 draws stand out; they point to a team that is often in matches but struggles to kill them off, which fits with their broader trend of frequently sharing the points.",
      "Espanyol, by contrast, occupy 6th place with 6 wins, 3 draws and 4 losses from 13 matches. They have scored 17 and conceded 16, averaging 1.31 scored and 1.23 conceded per game, with a goal difference of +1. Their record paints a picture of a side slightly more clinical in tight contests, converting marginal statistical edges into victories often enough to stay in the upper third of the table.",
      "Celta’s longer-term trends across all competitions reveal a solid foundation. They have won 7 of their last 14 matches and have not been defeated in 9 of their last 11. At home in all competitions, they have won 50% of their last 34 matches, which is respectable, but the detail is important: in the last 10 home games they have drawn 5 and have been winless in 8 of those 10. At league level this pattern is even clearer; in La Liga, Celta have drawn 50% of their last 14 matches and have not been defeated in 83% of their last 12. At Balaídos in the league, they are undefeated in 5 of their last 6 and winless in 83% of their last 12, with 6 draws in that span. It is a team very hard to beat but often unable to tilt games fully in its favour.",
      "Espanyol’s trends combine promise with vulnerability. In all competitions they have won 50% of their last 12 matches, underlining their positive momentum. However, over their last 10 away games in all competitions they have lost 50% and have been winless in 8 of those 10, which raises questions about their ability to replicate home form on the road. In La Liga, though, they have still managed to win 50% of their last 6 matches, even as they have lost 3 in that stretch, highlighting their high-variance nature."

Even more striking, they have lost by 2 or more goals in 43% of their last 7 away fixtures. While the overall Conte blueprint is clearly working, the team has not always transported its authority from Naples to hostile grounds.",
      "The historical balance between the sides in Rome has been relatively even. In the last 5 league meetings at the Olimpico, Roma have taken 1 win, there have been 2 draws and Napoli have 2 victories. Broaden that to the last 10 home clashes for Roma against Napoli in all competitions and the hosts have lost 50% of those matches, suggesting that Napoli have often found ways to disrupt Roma’s rhythm in this stadium, even when the Giallorossi have been strong overall in the league.",
      "Longer term trends give Roma reason for confidence. They have been undefeated in 21 of their last 26 home matches in all competitions and have won 26 of their last 40 home games overall, many of them with authority: 39% of their last 28 home fixtures in all competitions have been won by 2 or more goals. In Serie A alone, 38% of their last 21 home league matches have been victories by at least a 2 goal margin. Defensively, the profile is robust too, with 14 clean sheets in their last 30 home league games and average shots on target conceded kept under tight control.",

Across their last 40 matches in all competitions they have won 60% and been undefeated in 85%. Yet away from home, while there are 12 clean sheets in their last 30 away matches, the more recent pattern shows vulnerability, particularly when forced to chase games. A possession average of 52.67% away suggests they do not get overrun, but a shots on target figure of 3.47 hints at a more selective, transitional approach on the road."

Across their last 10 away games in all competitions, Napoli have lost 50%, and in their last 6 away matches they have been winless in 5 of those 6. Even more striking, they have lost by 2 or more goals in 43% of their last 7 away fixtures. While the overall Conte blueprint is clearly working, the team has not always transported its authority from Naples to hostile grounds.\n\nThe historical balance between the sides in Rome has been relatively even. In the last 5 league meetings at the Olimpico, Roma have taken 1 win, there have been 2 draws and Napoli have 2 victories. Broaden that to the last 10 home clashes for Roma against Napoli in all competitions and the hosts have lost 50% of those matches, suggesting that Napoli have often found ways to disrupt Roma’s rhythm in this stadium, even when the Giallorossi have been strong overall in the league.\n\nLonger term trends give Roma reason for confidence. They have been undefeated in 21 of their last 26 home matches in all competitions and have won 26 of their last 40 home games overall, many of them with authority: 39% of their last 28 home fixtures in all competitions have been won by 2 or more goals. In Serie A alone, 38% of their last 21 home league matches have been victories by at least a 2 goal margin. Defensively, the profile is robust too, with 14 clean sheets in their last 30 home league games and average shots on target conceded kept under tight control.\n\nNapoli’s broader data paints the picture of a high level side that occasionally leaves the door ajar. Across their last 40 matches in all competitions they have won 60% and been undefeated in 85%. Yet away from home, while there are 12 clean sheets in their last 30 away matches, the more recent pattern shows vulnerability, particularly when forced to chase games. A possession average of 52.67% away suggests they do not get overrun, but a shots on target figure of 3.47 hints at a more selective, transitional approach on the road.",

      "The Groupama Stadium is primed for Lyon versus Nantes, a fixture with intriguing recent history and significant implications for both teams. Lyon, anchored in seventh position, are looking to bounce back and reestablish themselves among the league's frontrunners. Nantes, traveling from fifteenth, face the dual challenge of lifting their season and overcoming a daunting away run.",
      "Whenever Nantes travel to Lyon, the visiting side has found points exceedingly hard to come by. In their last five visits to the Groupama Stadium, Lyon have taken four wins and drawn once, maintaining an undefeated record on home turf against Nantes over that period. This home dominance reflects a keen ability to control direct matchups, with Lyon frequently managing to keep Nantes' attack at bay.",
      "Lyon approach the encounter after a challenging stretch. They have managed only one win in their last six matches, alongside three draws and two defeats. Despite the low attacking returns, averaging just 1.17 goals per game in this period, their defense hasn't fared much better, conceding 1.5 per game. At home, however, Lyon have fared better, winning two of their previous three matches at Groupama, scoring an average of two and conceding just over one per game.",
      "Nantes, meanwhile, have similarly claimed only a single victory in their past six outings, coupled with two draws and three defeats. Their attack matches Lyon’s in output at 1.17 goals per game, but their defense has proven more vulnerable, allowing two goals per match on average. Notably, recent home form for Nantes is more stable, but that statistic carries less weight as they head on the road, where winless runs have become a concerning trend.",
      "After thirteen matches in Ligue 1’s regular season, Lyon hold a positive record of six wins, three draws, and four losses, with eighteen goals scored and fifteen conceded, yielding a goal difference of plus three. Nantes, in contrast, have won just twice, drawing five and losing six, and carry a minus seven goal difference, having conceded nineteen while notching twelve goals.",
      "Statistical trends over a longer horizon paint a clearer picture of both teams’ momentum. Lyon have been undefeated in twelve of their last fifteen home matches in all competitions, a streak mirrored by their recent record in Ligue 1, where they have gone undefeated in sixteen of their last twenty at home. Clean sheets are also common, with four out of ten in recent home league games. On the flip side, their most recent overall record shows winless spells in six out of their last seven league matches.",
      "Nantes’ main concern is a prolonged inability to claim wins on the road. They have been winless in sixteen of their last twenty away matches in all competitions and have lost half of their previous twelve away games. Furthermore, they have failed to win in seventeen of their last twenty-one competitive matches overall."

      "Bologna’s steady climb into the Serie A top five has not come by accident. Built on control, clean sheets and a clear identity, Andrade Davis Nicolas’ side now faces a Cremonese outfit searching for stability and goals. With one team quietly establishing European credentials and the other trying to halt a worrying slide, this meeting at the Dall’Ara looks like a test of maturity for the hosts and resilience for the visitors.",
      "These two clubs do not share a long, intense Serie A storyline, but their latest clash in Bologna offered a useful reference point. The last time Cremonese visited the Dall’Ara in the league, the match finished in a draw, giving Bologna a home record of 0 wins, 1 draw and 0 losses from their last 1 home encounter against the Grigiorossi. That stalemate underlined how awkward Cremonese can be to break down when they stay compact, and it lingers as a reminder that Bologna, for all their progress, still have to work hard to convert dominance into victories against well-organised visitors.",
      "Bologna enter this match in quietly imposing shape. Over their last 6 matches in all competitions, they are unbeaten with 3 wins, 3 draws and 0 losses. They have averaged 1.67 goals scored and only 0.5 conceded per game across that spell, suggesting a strong balance between attack and defence. The performance data backs that up: around 12.67 total shots per match, with 3.83 on target and an average possession of 55.67% shows a side that tends to control the ball and create a steady flow of chances rather than relying on chaotic spells.",
      "At home, Bologna’s last 3 fixtures have been even more defensively assured. They have 1 win, 2 draws and 0 defeats, scoring 0.67 goals per game but conceding none. The goal output is modest, yet the clean sheet record highlights how difficult it has become for visiting sides to find a way through at the Dall’Ara. They still average 12.67 shots and 3 on target with the same 55.67% possession at home in that short run, pointing to a consistent pattern of control even when the scoreboard has not always fully reflected their superiority.",
      "Cremonese’s recent path contrasts sharply. Across their last 6 matches in all competitions, they have 1 win, 2 draws and 3 losses. They are scoring 1 goal per game and conceding 1.33 on average, with 10.33 shots per match, 3.67 on target and roughly 49.17% possession. That paints a picture of a team that can create enough to be competitive but often finds itself on the wrong side of fine margins, especially defensively.",
      "The trend becomes more concerning when we stretch the sample. Cremonese have drawn 5 of their last 10 matches in all competitions and lost 4 of their last 8. Crucially, they have been winless in 11 of their last 11 matches in all competitions, an 82% winless rate in that sequence, and they come into this game on a run of 3 straight defeats and 3 straight matches without a victory. Stopping that slide against one of the league’s more settled outfits will require a significant improvement in both penalty-box areas.",
      "In Serie A, Bologna’s season so far looks firmly like that of a top-tier side. They sit 5th after 12 league games, with 7 wins, 3 draws and only 2 defeats. They have scored 21 goals, an average of 1.75 per match, and conceded just 8, or 0.67 per game, giving them a healthy goal difference of +13. Those numbers are not built on a short burst either. Over their last 40 league matches they have won 50%, and they are undefeated in 83% of their last 12 Serie A fixtures. At home in the league, they have won 63% of their last 40 games and are undefeated in 90% of their last 20, recording clean sheets in 50% of those 20 home encounters. This is one of the most reliable home records in the division.",
      "Cremonese, by contrast, are sitting 11th after 12 league matches. Their Serie A record reads 3 wins, 5 draws and 4 losses, with 13 goals scored, an average of 1.08 per match, and 16 conceded, 1.33 per game, for a goal difference of -3. It is not disastrous, but it illustrates a side that struggles to outscore opponents and often ends up sharing points or narrowly losing. Their broader trend, with extended winless sequences in all competitions, suggests that turning performances into consistent results has been a persistent issue for Davide Nicola’s men.",
      "Bologna’s long-term statistical profile is impressive. In all competitions, they have won 50% of their last 16 matches and drawn 50% of their last 6, underlining a habit of avoiding defeat. They have remained undefeated in 87% of their last 15 matches in all competitions and are currently undefeated in each of their last 11 games, a 100% undefeated run in that span.

In Serie A at the Dall’Ara, they have won 63% of their last 40 matches and stayed undefeated in 90% of their last 20, with half of those games ending in clean sheets.

However, with 4 defeats in their last 8 and that statistic of being winless in 11 of their last 11 matches in all competitions, confidence and momentum are clearly issues. Defensively they are not being overwhelmed, but their inability to string wins together leaves them vulnerable against teams with sharper attacking patterns."

      "Damak are set for a stiff challenge at Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Sports City Stadium as they take on an Al Ahli side carrying real momentum into this Professional League clash. With Damak yet to win a match this season, the contrast in recent form between the two teams could hardly be more stark.",
      "Reviewing the head-to-head data, Damak have found it tough when facing Al Ahli on their own patch. In the last three home matches against Al Ahli, Damak have drawn twice and suffered one defeat. This trend underscores the home side's difficulties in earning results against their visitors.",
      "Focusing on Damak's campaign so far, the numbers offer a sobering reality. Through nine league matches, Damak remain winless, drawing five times and losing four, with a goal difference of minus nine. They have managed fewer than one goal per match on average while conceding nearly two, placing them 16th in the table.",
      "The recent data is consistent with these struggles. Across their last six outings, Damak have not registered a single win, settling for four draws and two defeats. They have scored an average of only 0.83 goals per game during this stretch, while allowing two per match on average.",
      "Examining their home form, Damak continue to search for answers. The last three home games have brought two draws and one defeat, with the team averaging just 0.67 goals scored and conceding 1.33. In league terms, they have now gone winless in 10 of their last 12 home matches and 13 of their last 16 in all competitions.",
      "Statistical trends paint a broader picture of a team in the midst of a lengthy winless run. Damak have failed to win in 25 of their last 30 Professional League fixtures and are winless in 13 consecutive matches in all competitions. Notably, draws have become a regular occurrence with half of their last 10 league and cup matches ending all square.",

They have not tasted defeat in 18 of their last 20 matches across all competitions, including five wins and one draw in their last six league contests.

    "previewText": "Damak are set for a stiff challenge at Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Sports City Stadium as they take on an Al Ahli side carrying real momentum into this Professional League clash. With Damak yet to win a match this season, the contrast in recent form between the two teams could hardly be more stark.\n\nReviewing the head-to-head data, Damak have found it tough when facing Al Ahli on their own patch. In the last three home matches against Al Ahli, Damak have drawn twice and suffered one defeat. This trend underscores the home side's difficulties in earning results against their visitors.\n\nFocusing on Damak's campaign so far, the numbers offer a sobering reality. Through nine league matches, Damak remain winless, drawing five times and losing four, with a goal difference of minus nine. They have managed fewer than one goal per match on average while conceding nearly two, placing them 16th in the table.\n\nThe recent data is consistent with these struggles. Across their last six outings, Damak have not registered a single win, settling for four draws and two defeats. They have scored an average of only 0.83 goals per game during this stretch, while allowing two per match on average.\n\nExamining their home form, Damak continue to search for answers. The last three home games have brought two draws and one defeat, with the team averaging just 0.67 goals scored and conceding 1.33. In league terms, they have now gone winless in 10 of their last 12 home matches and 13 of their last 16 in all competitions.\n\nStatistical trends paint a broader picture of a team in the midst of a lengthy winless run. Damak have failed to win in 25 of their last 30 Professional League fixtures and are winless in 13 consecutive matches in all competitions. Notably, draws have become a regular occurrence with half of their last 10 league and cup matches ending all square.\n\nOn the other hand, Al Ahli come in full of confidence. They have not tasted defeat in 18 of their last 20 matches across all competitions, including five wins and one draw in their last six league contests. Their record through nine matches this season places them fourth, with five wins and four draws, scoring 1.33 goals per game and only conceding 0.67 on average.\n\nAl Ahli's defensive solidity stands out, keeping clean sheets in over half of their last 15 away matches.
