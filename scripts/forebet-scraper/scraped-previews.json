      "West Bromwich prepare to host Middlesbrough at The Hawthorns in a Championship matchup that promises a battle of defensive resilience against creative firepower. With both sides coming off contrasting spells in form, the stage is set for an encounter where every detail might prove decisive as the season progresses.",
      "When West Bromwich and Middlesbrough face off at The Hawthorns, recent seasons have produced competitive contests. In the last three home matches against Middlesbrough, West Bromwich have claimed two wins and suffered a single defeat, suggesting a slight edge when playing on their own turf. However, over the past six fixtures at The Hawthorns, West Bromwich have lost three, highlighting Middlesbrough's ability to challenge away from home.",
      "Looking further into the home fixtures split, it is notable that West Bromwich have managed to celebrate two wins by a margin of two or more goals in their last five meetings at home against Middlesbrough, demonstrating their occasional flair when it clicks.",
      "West Bromwich's last six matches reflect a side searching for consistency. With two wins and four losses, the Baggies have struggled to generate attacking fluidity, netting just once in those six outings, yet have maintained defensive discipline by conceding an average of 1.17 goals per match. The numbers at The Hawthorns, though, are somewhat more encouraging. In their last three home league matches, West Bromwich have won two and lost one, scoring 1.67 and conceding only a single goal on average per contest.",
      "Middlesbrough's recent form may be more balanced, with two wins, one draw, and three losses in their previous six. What's striking, however, is how miserly their defense has been; they’ve let in just 0.83 goals per game in that stretch. Their ability to dominate possession stands out as well, commanding an average of over 63% during this period. Yet, their away form in the last three sees them slip to a single win paired with two losses, and a goal average that dips to just 0.67 scored.",
      "Position in the standings dictates the mood around each camp. West Bromwich, currently 18th, have taken nine wins and four draws from 26 matches, with a negative goal difference at minus six after conceding 35 and scoring 29. Consistency at home is underscored by an undefeated streak in 16 of their last 20, but the lack of clean sheets and goals remains a concern.",
      "Middlesbrough, meanwhile, sit in second place and appear well-placed for promotion contention. Their 13 wins and seven draws in 26 games have led to a positive goal difference of plus eleven. Having scored 37 and conceded 26, they are more potent in attack and notably tighter at the back, underscored by just a single goal conceded per match on average."

      "The last meeting between these two sides took place on 5 October 2025, with Lille hosting PSG in a match that ended 1-1. Lille took the lead through Nuno Mendes in the 66th minute, but PSG found an equalizer via Ethan Mbappé in the 85th. The stats told the tale of Parisian dominance: PSG registered 17 total shots to Lille’s 9 and enjoyed 62% ball possession, compared to Lille’s 38%. Lille managed to create 43 dangerous attacks, narrowly edging PSG’s 41, but the visitors had five shots on target, while the hosts only managed three. In terms of control and attacking output, PSG left little doubt about their intent, but a resilient Lille side managed to hold firm for a share of the spoils.",

Over this stretch, they have averaged 2.5 goals per match while conceding just 0.67. At home over the last three league matches, PSG have claimed two victories and a draw, scoring 2.67 goals per game with an average possession of 66.33%.",
      "Lille’s recent league form is also noteworthy. They have won four of their last six, suffering two losses without a draw in this run. However, Lille’s goal production lags behind PSG, with an average of 1.17 scored and 1 conceded per match. Away from home, their numbers are less impressive, having registered four clean sheets in their last ten away matches.",

      "Lille, sitting 4th in the table with 10 wins from 17, have scored 33 and let in 22. Their goal difference of +11, paired with an average of 1.94 goals scored per game, highlights a balanced side, but their defense, conceding close to 1.3 per match, has left them with work to do against quality opposition.",
