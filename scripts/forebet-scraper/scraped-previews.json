Out of their last 6 home encounters with Heerenveen, the hosts have managed only 1 win, drawing 2, and losing 3. This run gives Heerenveen a subtle psychological advantage before a ball is kicked.",
      "When delving into recent form, PEC Zwolle have taken points in 5 of their last 6 matches across all competitions, yet just 2 of those were wins. They have drawn 3 during this run and suffered one defeat. Their defense, though, has been a concern, conceding an average of 2.5 goals per game while scoring 2.17 themselves.",
      "Their last 3 home matches reinforce an uncertain pattern. Zwolle split results with a win, draw, and loss apiece, scoring an average of only 1 goal while conceding twice per game. In these home fixtures, their possession numbers have been below par, averaging just 33.33%, and shots on goal are also limited at 3 per outing. Ball retention and shot creation remain areas requiring improvement.",
      "Heerenveen, meanwhile, offer a different narrative. Over their last 6 matches, they’ve recorded 3 wins, 2 draws, and just a single loss. They’re on a more stable path, scoring an average of 2.17 and conceding only 1.5. More notably, Heerenveen have posted a strong attacking display, producing 16 shots per match and hitting the target 7 times on average, coupled with a ball possession rate above 53%.",
      "In overall league performance, PEC Zwolle rest at 15th following 13 games, having won just 3, drawn 4, and lost 6 with a concerning negative goal difference of -13. Their matches are high-scoring but often at their expense, with 29 goals conceded already.",
      "Heerenveen’s position is more secure at 9th, picking up 4 wins and 5 draws from their 13 league outings. They’ve matched their goals for and against at 22, which points to a balanced, if sometimes unpredictable, approach on either end of the pitch.",
      "Historical and recent trends show Zwolle as vulnerable. In all competitions, they have been winless in 10 of their last 12 outings and have lost 50% of those matches. They have lost 3 of their last 6 home league games and kept just 4 clean sheets in their previous 10 at home. Against Heerenveen specifically, Zwolle have lost 3 of their last 6 at this venue.",
      "Heerenveen’s trends suggest growing confidence. They are undefeated in 9 of their last 11 matches in all competitions and have won 50% of their previous 10. In Eredivisie play, they haven’t tasted defeat in 80% of their last 10 matches. The only caution is their away record, winless in 83% of their past 12 away league games, indicating that they’ll need to ensure focus on the road.",
      "Injury and suspension woes further complicate Zwolle’s task. Key absentees include Braydon Manu (suspended), Odysseus Velanas and Zico Buurmeester (both ankle injuries), Tristan Gooijer (hamstring), Damian van der Haar, and first-choice goalkeeper Jasper Schendelaar. Heerenveen face fewer absences, with Levi Smans and Oliver Braude unavailable.",

      "Cesc Fàbregas has quietly turned Calcio Como into one of Serie A’s most measured and confident sides, and a visit from Fabio Grosso’s Sassuolo offers a sharp stylistic contrast: methodical domination of the ball on one side, direct pace and individual flair on the other.",
      "Calcio Como reach this match carrying one of the most solid runs in the division. Over their last 6 matches in all competitions they have 3 wins and 3 draws, scoring 1.67 goals per match and conceding only 0.33. The numbers behind those results are striking: an average of 12 shots, 4.67 on target, and a hefty 63.67% possession. At home, the pattern holds. In their last 3 matches at Stadio Giuseppe Sinigaglia they have 2 wins and 1 draw, with the same 1.67 goals scored and 0.33 conceded, and an almost identical possession average of 63.67%. This is a team that spends long stretches on the ball and rarely allows clean looks at goal.",
      "By contrast, Sassuolo’s recent form has been more uneven but still competitive. Across the last 6 matches in all competitions they have 2 wins, 2 draws and 2 losses, with 1.33 goals scored and 1 conceded per match. They attempt a similar volume of shots to Como, 12.33 per match with 3.67 on target, but at a more modest 50% possession. Their last 3 fixtures at home show how hard they can be to break down when compact, with 2 wins and 1 draw, conceding just 0.33 goals per match from an average of 9.67 shots and 45% possession. Sassuolo are comfortable without the ball and choose their moments to break.",
      "The head to head picture in this fixture is still being drawn, but the early brushstrokes are in Como’s favour. In the only home meeting on record from the data provided, Como claimed a win against Sassuolo, leaving the visitors with no points and no draw to show from that trip. It is a small sample, yet it fits a broader theme: Como tend to protect their home ground well, while Sassuolo have often had to chase games on the road. That single victory also gives Fàbregas a psychological reference point when preparing his side, reinforcing the notion that his approach can work against Grosso’s system.",
      "In the current Serie A regular season standings, Como sit 6th after 12 matches with 5 wins, 6 draws and just 1 defeat. They average 1.42 goals for and 0.58 against per match, producing a healthy +10 goal difference. Those numbers underline a balanced side that scores regularly but is built first on defensive stability. Sassuolo come in 9th, also with 5 wins but only 2 draws and 5 losses from their 12 league matches. They score 1.33 goals per game and concede 1.17, for a slimmer +2 goal difference. Grosso’s team is clearly more volatile: capable of winning, but more exposed when their press or transitions misfire.",
      "Como’s broader trends under Fàbregas are particularly strong. In all competitions they have won 50% of their last 14 matches and drawn 6 of their last 12, while they have not been defeated in 18 of their last 20. At home the numbers are even more impressive. Across their last 40 home games in all competitions they have 53% wins and have not been beaten in 33 of those 40. They have kept clean sheets in 40% of their last 15 home matches and have won by 2 or more goals in 50% of their last 12 home fixtures. Restricting the sample to Serie A only reinforces the picture: 55% wins in their last 20 league matches, 6 draws in their last 12, and undefeated in 22 of their last 27. At home in the league they have not lost in 80% of their last 20, with 40% of their last 10 home league victories coming by at least a 2 goal margin.",
      "Sassuolo’s trends are more mixed but show a team that is dangerous when their structure holds. In all competitions they have 23 wins in their last 40 matches, although they have also lost 8 of their last 16. Away from home they can be hard to penetrate, keeping clean sheets in 40% of their last 15 away fixtures and winning 6 of their last 12 on the road in all competitions. In Serie A specifically they have 16 wins in their last 30 league games, yet 7 defeats in their last 14. At home in Serie A they win 65% of their last 20, but a poor away sequence is what they are still trying to correct."

      "Getafe and Elche arrive at the Coliseum with very different ways of playing but strangely similar paths through this La Liga season. One side lives off efficiency and defensive discipline, the other leans on control of the ball and long spells of pressure. The numbers from the past few months suggest a contest that could be decided by fine margins rather than fireworks.",
      "When José Bordalás and Eder Sarabia look at the table, they will see two mid‑pack teams separated more by style than substance. Getafe sit 7th with 5 wins, 2 draws and 6 losses from 13 league matches, while Elche are 12th after 3 wins, 7 draws and 3 defeats. Both have negative goal differences, both have struggled to turn balance into clear superiority, and both tend to operate on small scorelines.",
      "The head to head story over the last eight meetings underlines how little separates these clubs. Getafe have taken 3 wins, Elche have managed 2, and 3 matches ended level. That pattern of near parity fits the way this fixture has often unfolded: compact, cautious, and rarely decided early. At the Coliseum, Getafe have drawn 2 of their last 4 home clashes against Elche, which reinforces the trend toward shared points rather than one‑sided outcomes.",
      "Those encounters have typically featured long phases of tactical sparring rather than open exchanges. Getafe’s physical, territorial approach has been met by Elche’s attempt to progress through midfield, and the result has often been matches where one goal or a single defensive lapse changed everything. With both coaches now leaning heavily on structured shapes again, history pushes this duel toward another tight affair.",
      "Getafe’s last 6 matches in all competitions read 3 wins and 3 losses, a perfectly balanced run that reflects their risk‑reward profile. They have averaged 2.33 goals scored and only 0.67 conceded in that spell, supported by 13.5 total shots per match and 4.83 on target, despite having just 46.67% possession on average. They are comfortable without the ball, but when they decide to attack, they create enough threat to make it count.",
      "At home, though, the picture is less positive. Over their last 3 matches at the Coliseum they have 1 win and 2 defeats, scoring just 0.67 goals per game and conceding 1. Their own attacking volume drops sharply to 9.33 shots and 2 on target, with possession falling to only 35%. Those numbers match a longer trend: across their last 30 home matches in La Liga they have been winless in 80% of them, and in the last 12 league games at home they have lost 7. The Coliseum has not been a fortress.",
      "Elche’s recent form tells a slightly different story. Across their last 6 matches in all competitions they have 1 win, 3 draws and 2 losses, scoring 1.33 and conceding 1.17 per game. The standout figure is their 63.5% average possession and 5.67 shots on target from 15 attempts. They see a lot of the ball and manage a steady stream of efforts on goal, but they struggle to convert that superiority into victories. They are undefeated in 80% of their last 15 matches in all competitions, yet also winless in 86% of their last 7 games, a sign of a team that draws more than it decides.",
      "In league terms, Getafe’s 12 goals in 13 matches, an average of 0.92 per game, underline how conservative their approach is. They concede 1.15 per match, so most of their league fixtures are settled by a single goal either way. Over their last 30 La Liga matches they have lost 16, with only 3.13 shots on target and 40.1% possession on average, which again shows a side that prefers compactness over initiative.",
      "Elche, by contrast, have 15 goals and 16 conceded from 13 league games, hovering around the same narrow margins. Their broader league trends look contradictory at first glance: undefeated in 80% of their last 30 La Liga outings, but winless in 80% of their last 10 league matches. In essence, they are very hard to beat but frequently fall short of finishing teams off, illustrated by 7 draws in their last 14 league matches.",
      "Bordalás’s Getafe remain heavily reliant on defensive structure. Across their last 20 matches in all competitions they have lost 55%, but they allow very few clear chances, with just 3.35 shots on target conceded on average and limited possession at 40.8%. At home, their last 15 matches in all competitions include 53% defeats and only 2.93 shots on target going forward, aligned with that 80% winless run in both all competitions and La Liga specifically.",
      "Elche’s trends almost mirror the opposite side of the same coin. They thrive on control: 58% possession and 4.07 shots on target in their last 14 league games, and away from home they still see around 60.17% of the ball with 4.83 attempts on target across the last 6 away fixtures in all competitions. Yet those away matches contain 50% losses and a 7‑game winless run, showing that possession has not translated reliably into points."

      "Relegation fear on one side, continental dreams on the other: Juventude and Bahia walk into Estádio Alfredo Jaconi carrying very different burdens, but both knowing this meeting could define how their Brasileiro Serie A story is remembered.",
      "On paper, Juventude against Bahia looks like a meeting of unequal partners. Juventude sit 19th with 9 wins, 6 draws and 20 losses from 35 rounds, while Bahia arrive in Caxias do Sul in 6th place after 16 wins, 8 draws and 11 defeats. Yet their recent history suggests this fixture rarely follows the league table neatly, and the details behind the numbers tell a more nuanced story.",
      "Head to head, Bahia have had the upper hand in recent years. Across the last 5 meetings between the sides in all competitions, Bahia have taken 3 victories, Juventude just 1, with 1 draw. Two of those Bahia wins came by at least two goals, underlining how often the Salvador side have managed to stretch the scoreline once in front. For Juventude, the lone win in that sequence is a reminder they can trouble Bahia, but the broader pattern leans clearly towards Rogério Ceni’s team.",
      "Thiago Carpini’s Juventude are fighting the numbers as much as their opponents. In the league, they score only 0.94 goals per match and concede 1.83, giving a heavy goal difference of -31. Over their last 6 matches in all competitions, they have 2 wins, 1 draw and 3 losses, scoring 1.67 and conceding 1.83 per game.

They shoot more frequently at home, with 13.33 total attempts and 6.67 on target, yet possession dips to 42.67%. Over a longer stretch, their all‑competitions profile at home is unstable: they have won 11 of their last 22 home matches, but they have also lost 50% of their last 14 at Jaconi and are winless in 86% of their last 7 home fixtures. Across their last 30 matches in all competitions, Juventude have lost 60% and have been beaten by 2 or more goals in 12 of them, which shows how quickly things can unravel when they fall behind.",

Their 47 league goals at 1.34 per match are significantly higher than Juventude’s output, and they concede only 1.23 per game. Over the last 6 matches in all competitions, though, Bahia mirror Juventude’s inconsistency: 2 wins, 1 draw and 3 losses, with 1.17 goals scored and 1.83 conceded per game.

    "previewText": "Relegation fear on one side, continental dreams on the other: Juventude and Bahia walk into Estádio Alfredo Jaconi carrying very different burdens, but both knowing this meeting could define how their Brasileiro Serie A story is remembered.\n\nOn paper, Juventude against Bahia looks like a meeting of unequal partners. Juventude sit 19th with 9 wins, 6 draws and 20 losses from 35 rounds, while Bahia arrive in Caxias do Sul in 6th place after 16 wins, 8 draws and 11 defeats. Yet their recent history suggests this fixture rarely follows the league table neatly, and the details behind the numbers tell a more nuanced story.\n\nHead to head, Bahia have had the upper hand in recent years. Across the last 5 meetings between the sides in all competitions, Bahia have taken 3 victories, Juventude just 1, with 1 draw. Two of those Bahia wins came by at least two goals, underlining how often the Salvador side have managed to stretch the scoreline once in front. For Juventude, the lone win in that sequence is a reminder they can trouble Bahia, but the broader pattern leans clearly towards Rogério Ceni’s team.\n\nThiago Carpini’s Juventude are fighting the numbers as much as their opponents. In the league, they score only 0.94 goals per match and concede 1.83, giving a heavy goal difference of -31. Over their last 6 matches in all competitions, they have 2 wins, 1 draw and 3 losses, scoring 1.67 and conceding 1.83 per game. The averages suggest a side capable of creating chances, with 10.17 total shots and 5.83 on target, but one that often plays without the ball, with only 43% average possession.\n\nAt Estádio Alfredo Jaconi, Juventude’s numbers are slightly better but still inconsistent.

      "Two sides separated by a single point in the La Liga table meet at Son Moix with more than just mid-table pride at stake. Real Mallorca and Osasuna both know that a narrow victory could reshape their season, while another setback would keep them anchored near the danger zone.",
      "These two clubs know each other well, and their recent clashes have usually been balanced affairs. Across the last 5 meetings in all competitions, Mallorca have managed 1 win, Osasuna have taken 1, and there have been 3 draws. That pattern mirrors how these games tend to feel: tight, physical and often decided by small details rather than long stretches of dominance from either side.",
      "Those 5 matches underline how difficult it is for either team to pull clear. Mallorca have avoided defeat in 4 of those 5 encounters, which quietly suggests a slight psychological edge, particularly when they can lean on structure and defensive discipline. For Osasuna, that run shows they are rarely outclassed by Mallorca, but also that turning parity into victories has been an issue.",
      "Mallorca come into this fixture with a solid base of results over their last 6 matches in all competitions: 3 wins, 1 draw and 2 losses. They have scored an average of 1.33 goals and conceded 1.17, generated 14.83 shots per match with 4.83 on target, and held 51.33% possession. Those numbers describe a side that is competitive in most phases, with enough attacking output to trouble opponents without being particularly prolific.",
      "At Son Moix, that profile sharpens. Across their last 3 home matches in all competitions, Mallorca have 2 wins and 1 draw, scoring 1 goal per game and conceding only 0.33. Their shot volume dips slightly to 12.67 attempts and 3.67 on target, with 47% possession, but the defensive stability is striking. Keeping opponents down to a third of a goal per match over that spell has turned home games into controlled, low-scoring contests.",
      "Osasuna’s recent run tells a tougher story. Over their last 6 matches in all competitions they have 1 win, 1 draw and 4 losses, even though their goal figures are level at 1.33 scored and 1.33 conceded per game. They attempt 12.83 shots per match with an impressive 5.17 on target and average 52.17% possession, so the underlying numbers hint at a team that plays with the ball and creates chances but struggles to convert performances into results.",
      "Osasuna’s most recent \"home\" data is less relevant for this trip, but it is still notable that in their last 3 at El Sadar they have 1 win, 1 draw and 1 loss, scoring 1.67 and conceding only 0.33 on average. That suggests defensive potential, yet the picture changes sharply once they leave Pamplona.",
      "In the La Liga table, Mallorca sit 16th after 13 games with 3 wins, 3 draws and 7 losses. They have scored 13 goals, exactly 1 per match, and conceded 20, an average of 1.54 per game, for a goal difference of -7. The numbers point to a side that is often in games but pays a price for the occasional lapse at the back.",
      "Osasuna, in 17th place, are just below them with 3 wins, 2 draws and 8 defeats from 13 league matches. Their attack has been more blunt at league level, with 10 goals at 0.77 per match, while they concede 16 at 1.23 per game for a goal difference of -6. They are slightly tighter defensively than Mallorca in league play, but the lack of scoring power has made their margin for error extremely small.",
      "Mallorca’s broader trends show a team that has grown stubborn, particularly at home. In their last 8 matches in all competitions they have a 50% win rate, with 4.25 shots on goal and 49.38% possession on average. Stretching the sample out, they have lost 20 of their last 40 matches in all competitions, and 50% of their last 40 in La Liga, which underlines how often they are pushed back at top level, but the current shorter run is clearly more positive.",
      "Recent home form is even more encouraging for Javier Aguirre’s side: in their last 6 home games in all competitions, they have drawn 50% and remained undefeated in 83%. The same pattern holds in La Liga at Son Moix, where across the last 6 home league matches they have also drawn 50% and stayed unbeaten in 83%. Set against that, they have been winless in 16 of their last 20 league fixtures overall, a reminder that consistency across all venues is still missing.",
      "Osasuna’s long view is more troubling. In all competitions they have lost 8 of their last 16 matches and been winless in 8 of their last 10. Away from home that difficulty intensifies: across their last 15 away games in all competitions they have lost 53%, and they have been winless in 83% of their last 12 away fixtures. In La Liga, they have lost 50% of their last 18 matches and have been winless in 82% of their last 11 league outings. Those are the figures of a side that often competes but rarely gets over the line.",
      "Interestingly, Osasuna’s home-based league stats are strong, with 5 clean sheets in their last 12 home league matches and 18 wins across their last 36 home league games, staying undefeated in 80% of their last 10 at El Sadar. The problem for this match is that all of that solidity is linked to Pamplona rather than to their travels."

This looks less like a glamour showcase and more like a hard-nosed test of who manages risk better over 90 minutes.",

In the last 4 home matches for Parma against Udinese, the Gialloblù have taken 1 win, shared the points twice and lost once. Nothing in that run suggests a one-sided matchup; instead, it underlines how often these games get decided by small details rather than long spells of dominance.",

Carlos Antón Cuesta’s side sit 15th with 2 wins, 5 draws and 5 defeats from 12 league games, scoring only 9 goals at an average of 0.75 per match while conceding 15 at 1.25 per game.

They are not being blown away, but they rarely pull away either. Their attacking volume is low: 9.17 total shots per match, only 3.33 of those on target, and an average possession of 36.67%, which suggests a side more comfortable ceding the ball and trying to be compact.",

They actually shoot a bit more at home, 10.33 attempts per match, but only 2.67 reach the target, and possession drops slightly to 35.67%. The historical trends reinforce that picture: in all competitions, Parma have drawn 50% of their last 12 games and have been winless in 85% of their last 13.
