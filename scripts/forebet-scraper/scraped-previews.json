      "Two teams with contrasting routes through the League Stage meet with plenty still on the line: Sparta Praha’s high-control approach faces an Aberdeen side that has learned to live on narrow margins and tidy structure.",
      "The League Stage picture makes the contrast clear. Sparta Praha sit in the top cluster with 3 wins, 1 draw and 1 loss, scoring 7 and conceding just 3 for a +4 differential. Aberdeen are buried deeper at 0 wins from 5, two draws to show for it, and an 11 against tally that has hurt their goal difference.",
      "Form across all competitions adds nuance. Sparta’s last six reads 4 wins, 1 draw and 1 loss, with 1.67 goals scored and 1.33 conceded on average. They generate 15.83 shots per match and keep the ball for 67.67%, so the pattern is familiar: pressure, territory, and enough creativity to tilt most contests.",
      "Home data is the wrinkle. Over the last three at their place across all competitions, Sparta have gone 0 wins, 2 draws and 1 loss despite averaging 21.67 shots and 76.67% possession. That said, their league-specific home profile remains robust, with 4 clean sheets in their last 7 Conference League home matches and 6 unbeaten in their last 7 at home in this competition.",
      "Aberdeen arrive with a sturdier near-term run across all competitions than their League Stage record suggests. Their last six show 3 wins, 2 draws and just 1 defeat, averaging 1.67 scored and 1.17 conceded, with 15.5 shots and 5.17 on target from a 51.83% share of the ball.",
      "On the road across all competitions, Aberdeen have stayed unbeaten in 5 of their last 6 and claimed 7 clean sheets in their last 17 away outings. There is resilience, though they have also lost by 2 or more in 5 of their last 12 away matches, a sign that when they do crack, the margin can widen.",
      "The League Stage trend tells a harsher story for the visitors. Aberdeen are winless in 13 of their last 16 Conference League matches and have lost 50% of their last 14 in this competition, with 50% of their last 10 ending level. It is a sequence that explains their current placement despite some recent upticks elsewhere.",
      "Sparta’s broader body of work is stronger. They have been unbeaten in 80% of their last 10 Conference League matches and have won 57% of their last 7 at home in this competition, including 4 wins by 2 or more in that span. Across all competitions, they are undefeated in 80% of their last 15 and have won 55% of their last 40 overall.",
      "Stylistically, this could hinge on Sparta’s ability to convert sustained pressure into cleaner chances. Their volume is rarely in doubt, but Aberdeen’s comfort in a compact shape plus quick wide outlets has improved. Set pieces and transitions for the visitors versus structured circulation and wingback thrusts for the hosts frame the likely dynamic.",
      "Squad notes matter for Sparta. Angelo Preciado and Jakub Martinec are unavailable, as are Magnus Kofod Andersen, Vojtech Vorel and Dominik Hollý, which pushes Pavel Kadeřábek and Matěj Ryneš into prominent wing roles and keeps the Asger Sørensen led back three intact around options like Jaroslav Zelený and Patrik Vydra."

      "Two unbeaten runs meet with very different personalities. Shakhtar have been purring along with the ball, Rijeka thriving without it. The result should hinge on who bends first: possession or pragmatism.",
      "Shakhtar reach this stage in assured form and with the numbers to match the eye test. In the Conference League league stage they are 4 wins, 0 draws and 1 loss, scoring 10 and conceding 5 for a +5 goal difference, good for second place after five matches. Across their last six in all competitions they are 4 wins, 2 draws and 0 losses, averaging 2.83 goals for and just 0.5 against with 67.67% possession and 6.83 shots on target per match.",
      "Their home levels have been even more assertive. Over the last three home matches in all competitions Shakhtar are 2 wins, 1 draw and 0 losses, with a striking 4.67 goals scored per game, 7.33 shots on target and 69.67% possession. Bigger-picture trends back that up: they have not been defeated in 27 of their last 30 matches in all competitions, and they are unbeaten in 9 straight. At home, 85% of their last 40 have finished without defeat, and 50% of their last 12 home wins came by 2 or more goals.",
      "Rijeka arrive with a different profile but similarly positive momentum. Their league stage card reads 2 wins, 2 draws and 1 loss, five scored and only two conceded for +3 and 14th place, a defensive return of 0.4 goals against per game. In the last six across all competitions they mirror Shakhtar’s results at 4 wins, 2 draws and 0 losses, scoring 2.67 and conceding 0.5 on average while operating with 41.33% possession and 5.17 shots on target per match.",
      "The split in approach is clear. Shakhtar’s control game routinely produces territory and shooting volume, while Rijeka prefer a compact block and quick surges through the middle third. Rijeka’s recent streaks are notable: three consecutive wins, each by 2 or more goals. They also have been undefeated in 10 of their last 12 matches in all competitions (83%).",
      "There is a caveat away from home for the Croatian side. Rijeka are winless in 5 of their last 6 away matches in all competitions (83%), and 50% of that run ended level. Against a side that regularly tilts the pitch, that away trend could matter, especially if Shakhtar again reach their usual 6 to 7 shots on target at home.",
      "Tactically, this shapes as 4-1-4-1 or 4-2-3-1 for Shakhtar, with two playmakers between the lines and energetic wide midfielders pinning back full backs. Rijeka’s best work has come from a 4-2-3-1 that keeps distances tight, trusting the double pivot to clog central lanes and spring the front four into space.",
      "Individual battles should be decisive. Shakhtar’s midfield trio of Oleg Ocheretko, Dmytro Kryskiv and Pedrinho has balanced control with penetration in recent weeks, while Newerton and Lucas Ferreira offer direct running from the flanks. Lassina Traoré provides a traditional reference point up front and a target for early crosses.",
      "For Rijeka, Tiago Dantas sets the rhythm at the base, with Niko Janković and Amer Gojak offering vertical passing and late entries into the box. Width from Toni Fruk and Luka Menalo stretches back lines, and Ante Matej Jurić works the channels. The defensive axis of Stjepan Radeljić and Ante Majstorović has been stingy in this league stage, part of a unit that has allowed just two goals in five matches."

      "Two teams with similar records but very different rhythms meet with qualification nuance hanging in the air. Sigma’s slide contrasts with Lech’s measured consistency, and the numbers hint at a cagey contest where small margins could decide everything.",
      "Both clubs sit on 7 points after five UEFA Europa Conference League league-stage matches, but the paths have differed. Sigma Olomouc are 22nd with 2 wins, 1 draw and 2 losses, scoring 6 and conceding 7. Lech Poznan are 20th with the same 2 wins, 1 draw and 2 losses, yet a stronger goal profile at 10 for and 7 against. The table says even; the trend lines say otherwise.",
      "Recent form for Sigma has been rough. Over the last six in all competitions they have 1 win, 1 draw and 4 losses, averaging 0.83 goals scored and 2 conceded. Their overall shot production sits at 12.83 attempts per match with 3.33 on target, alongside 49.33% possession. The bright spot comes from their last three at home in all competitions, where they posted 2 wins and 1 loss, scoring 1.33 and conceding 0.67 with improved 4.67 shots on target from 13 total attempts, even if possession dipped to 42.67%.",
      "Lech arrive on a steady run. Across their last six in all competitions they are unbeaten with 3 wins and 3 draws, scoring 1.83 and conceding 0.67 on average. Their shot profile is strong at 13.83 attempts and 4.83 on target per match, and they have controlled the ball at 55.17%. That blend of volume and defensive restraint has underpinned their 100% unbeaten streak across those six.",
      "Comparing the underlying numbers, Lech’s attack has the higher ceiling with 10 league-stage goals from five matches and better chance creation lately. Sigma’s recent defensive tightening at home matters, though, especially given those 0.67 goals conceded across their last three home outings in all competitions. The game state could favor a controlled tempo, with Lech’s 55.17% possession average meeting a Sigma side comfortable without the ball.",
      "The trends add important context. Sigma have lost each of their last 4 in all competitions and are winless in 4 straight. Yet at home they have kept clean sheets in 58% of their last 12 and have been undefeated in 83% of those 12, winning 6. It is a profile of a side far more resilient on their own pitch than their recent overall skid suggests.",
      "For Lech, resilience travels. They are undefeated in 16 of their last 20 away matches in all competitions and have posted 13 clean sheets across their last 32 away fixtures. In all competitions they have been undefeated in 80% of their last 15. League-specific numbers show a strong backbone too, with 16 undefeated in their last 20 Conference League matches, though they have also lost 3 of their last 6 in the competition, hinting at occasional volatility.",
      "Personnel could tilt fine margins. Sigma are without Yunusa Muritala, removing a direct outlet in transition. Lech lack Patrik Wålemark and Daniel Håkans, while Luis Palma is suspended. That pushes creative burden toward Ali Gholizadeh and Leo Bengtsson in support of Mikael Ishak, with Pablo Rodríguez linking play. For Sigma, craft and control fall to Radim Breite and Michal Beran, while Jáchym Šíp and Artur Dolznikov must supply the final-third spark.",
      "Tactically, both sides have leaned on 4-2-3-1 in their recent samples. Sigma’s recent home data suggests a compact block and selective pressing, while Lech’s structure should emphasize ball circulation and diagonal service to the flanks. Set pieces and second phases may be decisive given the expected territorial balance."
