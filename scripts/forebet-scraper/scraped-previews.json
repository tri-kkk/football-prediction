      "Cup ties often hinge on who manages the key moments, and Wolverhampton host Shrewsbury with the numbers pointing one way while a few longer-term trends whisper caution. The visitors arrive struggling for goals, the hosts with a recent uptick, and both leaning into familiar shapes that could decide control in midfield.",
      "Wolverhampton come in with a mixed last six in all competitions at 1 win, 2 draws and 3 losses, averaging 1.17 goals scored and 1.33 conceded. Their approach has been direct rather than possession heavy, with 9.17 shots per match, 4 on target and 39.67% possession across that span.",
      "Shrewsbury’s last six read 0 wins, 2 draws and 4 losses in all competitions, a run built on a lean attack at 0.5 goals per match and 2.17 shots on target from 8.67 attempts. They have seen more of the ball than Wolves on average at 46.5% but have struggled to turn phases into clear chances.",
      "These clubs have not crossed paths often, yet the most recent meeting at Molineux went the way of the hosts, with Wolverhampton winning the last home head to head. That edge matters in knockout football where small sample head to head moments can weigh on approach.",
      "Shrewsbury’s broader cup record deserves mention. In the FA Cup specifically, they have won 60% of their last 15 matches, a useful counterbalance to their league and all-competitions form and a sign they can set up effectively for one-off ties.",
      "At Molineux across the last three home matches in all competitions, Wolves are 1 win and 2 losses, scoring 1.33 and conceding 2.00 on average from 9.33 shots and 4 on target, with 37.67% possession. Shrewsbury’s last three overall yielded 0 wins, 1 draw and 2 losses, 0.67 scored and 1.67 conceded. The top-line metrics tilt toward the hosts, especially in chance creation and conversion.",
      "Wolves have a recent lift with a 3-match undefeated streak in all competitions, yet the long view warns they have been winless in 18 of their last 20 in all competitions and have lost 20 of their last 30. They have also lost by 2 or more in 6 of their last 15, and at home have fallen in 24 of their last 40, with 12 of their last 15 home matches ending winless. Even so, their shots on target at home hold around 4.35 per match.",
      "Shrewsbury are winless in 16 of their last 20 in all competitions. They have drawn 50% of their last 8 and lost 50% of their last 14. Away from home the picture is harsh, with 63% of their last 40 away games ending in defeat, winless in 26 of their last 30 away, and 11 of those 30 away defeats by 2 or more. That travel profile is a key factor against higher-tier opposition.",
      "Wolves have leaned on 3-5-2, using energy from the wingbacks and Hwang’s movement up front. Their numbers suggest quick transitions over long possessions, so the first pass into the front two and the surge from the half-spaces by Arias or Hugo Bueno could be decisive. Shrewsbury have alternated between 3-4-1-2 and 4-2-3-1, but the back three with a tucked playmaker suits containment and counters into Marquis and Lloyd."

The shot profile is healthy at 12.67 attempts and 3.67 on target per match, with an average 50% share of the ball that suggests they are comfortable mixing phases rather than chasing it.",

They have also won 8 of their last 15 home fixtures and posted 3 wins by 2 or more goals in their last 7 at home, underlining that when they get control, they can stretch a lead.",

At home in this competition, they have taken 8 wins in their last 13, a reminder that their ground has hosted enough strong performances in knockout football to keep the tie live.",
      "Leicester City arrive with punch but some variance. Over their last 6 matches in all competitions, Martí Cifuentes Corvillo’s team are 3 wins and 3 losses, scoring 1.67 and conceding 2.0. The shot count sits at 9.0 attempts with 2.5 on target and 47.33% possession on average, a profile that hints at moments of control rather than dominance, and a defense that can be asked questions.",

They have also lost by 2 or more goals in 35% of those last 40 away trips. Countering that, they have still won 50% of their last 12 in all competitions, underscoring a capacity to spike performance on the right day.",
      "Cheltenham’s approach likely leans on a compact 4-3-3, quick width and set-piece detail. With 12.67 shots per game and 3.67 on target, they create enough to matter if transitions are clean. Expect a measured press and an emphasis on early delivery from wide areas to test Leicester’s central pairing and full backs.",
      "Leicester, typically aligned in a 4-2-3-1, will look to tilt the game through their wide creators and the central link. Issahaku Fatawu and Stephy Mavididi threaten directness, while Bobby De Cordova-Reid offers the connective tissue between midfield and the front. The key is raising shot volume beyond 9.0 attempts; if they do, their finishing quality can tell.",

Both managers have crucial choices to make with personnel and tactics, and recent meetings suggest a competitive, tactical contest awaits.",

Their performance at home has also been patchy, with just one win from the last three home matches and two defeats, scoring and conceding an average of two goals per match.",
      "Mainz, on the other hand, continue to grapple with poor form. They have won only once in their last six, drawn three, and lost two, scoring an average of just 0.83 goals per game while conceding 1.33. Their away performances reflect broader problems, as they have failed to secure a win in 82% of their last 11 away matches in all competitions.",

Union’s dominance is further underlined by their overall edge across the last 20 meetings.",

      "Union’s last six matches in all competitions feature a perfectly balanced outcome—three wins and three losses, but their home form is showing signs of stress. Five of their last six home matches in all competitions have ended without victory. However, they have avoided defeat in five of their last six Bundesliga home games, suggesting a greater stubbornness on their own turf in league matches.",

The visitors have drawn 50% of their last eight Bundesliga games, but failing to convert draws into wins is costly. Notably, Mainz have not won any of their last 12 home matches in the Bundesliga but take a four-game undefeated streak in all competitions into this fixture, largely built on draws."
